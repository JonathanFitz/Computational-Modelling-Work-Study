ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah . That's okay . That's okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Am I starting now ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Anytime ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Oh sorry . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	'Kay , um . Alright , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	welcome back fro to the second meeting . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Um , and um , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I'll be taking minutes on this one , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um , so , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And , um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	So , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	sorry ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So , um , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	take it away Poppy . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Um , do I need to 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	It's , it's plugged in . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	So , um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	plugged in . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	F_ okay . Function F_ eight . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Sorry about this guys . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	No problem . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	'Kay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	is on . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I will take this time just to apologise . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	But there we go . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	I'm sure it's fine . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	and what we actually need to do , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	and what the remote control needs to do . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um , from 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um , one is the visibility in the dark , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	which was um Genevieve's idea . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	And we could use illuminated buttons , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	A automatically , um lights up at first touch . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Or we could use fluorescent materials 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um , also we could use um an alarm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um , so that would work . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	oop . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Go back there . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and I think that would be very important for products now . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	'Cause all , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	we all know that our resources are being limited , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	and we have to be very environmentally conscious . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Right , um , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	one question . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	And then 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	they would , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	um you would make the , the product as you normally would , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	and then either reuse some bits , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Or would we contribute to another group ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	You could 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	For a certain percentage at least . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Alright . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	but 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	This sounds like a really great idea . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Well I 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Because of this , their properties are smart material . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Alright . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	but 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Alright . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I like the environmental approach . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Um also there is um components . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	This'll be how it uh will actually work . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	But I haven't put this plan together yet . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I'm sorry , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	There we go 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	could you 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	. Sorry , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	should I go back . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Those were um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	This would actually show the circuit diagram . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	So I just put all those components in . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Those are all the 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I it just shows what sort of energy source . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	It could be a battery , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	like rechargeable probably . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Um , an' yeah , well 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Alright . Great . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Or escape ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	There we go . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Alright . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Thank you very much . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Thank you . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	There you go Tara . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Thanks . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Can you see ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Oh , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Do you think 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Is it uh , function eight yeah ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Function F_ eight . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Function F_ eight . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Function F_ eight . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Sorry . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	The one at the top . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Oh right . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	That looks right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I'm the User um User Interface Designer . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	There're two functional design options . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I'm sorry , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	what was that last one . Multifunctional and 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Sorry . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um , a single function just for the television itself . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Ch Oh , I see . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	'Kay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	because it's easier to use . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And less functions would have to be included . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So it would be cheaper to make . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Does anyone have any questions ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Right . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	yeah , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Right . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	other entertainment devices . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Does everyone agree with this ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And limit the design . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Do you think ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I think I agree with the single design thing for now , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Okay . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Alright . Sounds great . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Mm , 'kay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Alright , well , um , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yes I am . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Fabulous . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Except you're not hooked up to the 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Oh , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I'm not hooked up , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	but other than that , completely ready . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Great . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Oh . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	I just lost my microphone . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	No problem , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Just a moment . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	we can 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And I'll show you my findings . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Oh , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	So I think that should be our priority here . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So that it's something that fits in the household . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I'm sorry , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	what was that last thing that you just said ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Mm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	um , to influence our remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay , so the findings . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Which is a , quite a significant number . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I'm sorry , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	They're you know thumb-masters . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	That A very small amount . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Thought that was interesting . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Alright , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	the single function . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yes . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah that's a good point . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And uh how important the uh users find them . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	That's a huge amount . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	This is the most important button . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And it's used on average four times an hour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Relevance is two . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Um , and relevance of one point five . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	We're getting to specific statistics here . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	I don't know if you can help me . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Flipping pages . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Is that 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	It's um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	It's like the news . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Or like information . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	It has 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	The 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	and what's on . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	So like a running banner , underneath 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	It's um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	No 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	No , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	li Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I haven't used it before 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Oh . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	but 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	It's like 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And you have page numbers like for the menu , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It's like very basic internet . Sort of , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Very basic internet , yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	um 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	But you have 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Like tells you the weather , and 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	But you have no interaction back with it , you know . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Alright . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Well I guess I'm not with it , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	because I wasn't 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Channel settings . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	would it be ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	P Sorry . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Changing the channels ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Tuning them in at the very start . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Oh , okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	do you th do you think ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah . Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Remote controls are often lost somewhere . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So it should be very user-friendly , you know . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	People know what to do very quickly . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Repeti Uh . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Ah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I think . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Is that what it is ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	People with arthritis and such ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	That's rather sad . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Um , maybe our 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah , yeah . I think it is . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I'm not 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	designers can look into that . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	That's a problem . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . It is . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Did you guys uh get that one down ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yep . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Um okay , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	here's some ideas for you . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So I'll show you some numbers here . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	And if we have the budget for it . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um , financially and and functionally . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Mm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So that , that's a whole other field of research . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Um and depending on how many members you have in households . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Wonder if it would have 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	If we're looking for a simplistic design , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	if 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Mm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	It looks like 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	It'd be like the ultimate remote . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Um okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Not practical . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Oh sorry , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	just , just a screen , like a computer screen . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	S Or like um 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mobile phone . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Or Like an alarm clock . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	What , what would appear on the screen ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I have no idea still . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I'm sorry . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Oh just like an electronic screen . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Oh , on the remote . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Um , now that's , I , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Could it it 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	But that would probably be 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Like linked in with the teletext , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . That would be good , yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	or sort of like an 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Might be quite expensive to do that though . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm , Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Could be . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Um , we want something that people want in their home . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Every remote control looks the same , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Mm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Um , and for all , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	the other thing is like age market . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	stick to the basics . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	and , yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Right . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Twenties . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yep . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Alright . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	That's it for the market research . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Um , for many reasons . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So um we have that decision sort of made for us . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Can I just interrupt ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yep . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Would you like to plug in your 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Maybe we can do the 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay , sure . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah I do . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	I'm looking at looking at it right now . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay . Thanks . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	There you go . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	thank you . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Oh , come back screen . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212		
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Um , well , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Alright , and another thing . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Just 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	but , another thing is that , um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Work on that . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah , I think . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Real Reaction ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Um , yes , those are the changes . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	It'll It won't have teletext . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Okay , so I 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Is that how most people feel about that ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I think it would be annoying though if 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	if 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	You'd Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	So is it just 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Never heard of it . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Alright . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	. I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Do you know if anywhere else has it ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I don't know . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	I don't know . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I don't know . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	More research required , I think . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Alright . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	But if 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Was it a management decision that we're having 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	It was a management decision , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	So 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay then . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	'Kay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	'Kay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Um . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Minimal 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	And the 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	What was the word they used ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	F findability is important . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213		
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . The same signalling . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	I mean 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	It's not that expensive to do . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Like you just a , a buzz or something . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah . Okay . I like that idea . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	so 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	If 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	you'd ha 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Do you mean the the link between the 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah , with the button that you pressed . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Well , if the button was actually on 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . The button 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Oh . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Oh , yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Minor detail there . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Maybe 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah , it would have t 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Obviously something small that's 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah , that's a good point . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Would it need a battery then ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Maybe , um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Pr probably . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Probably , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	I mean . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Unless it could be 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	That's your department 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	you'll have to sort that out . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I mean the power for the T_V_ . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	So , mm , more research into that one . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah , you'll have to 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	you'll have to investi Do some research on that , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	alright ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Great . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Um , alright , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	and I'm sure that , um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Is everyone interested in that ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Y 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	On the buttons ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I I like the light up suggestion . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	I think that would be better . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	it doesn't 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	I would go for 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	It could it could be a tactile thing as well . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	And there's something on it . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Like a raised 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Well just the numbers could be embossed , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	couldn't it ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Like raised . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	The numbers themselves . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . Could be raised . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	I'm not sure . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	That's true . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	But I mean 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	That , I think that's good , yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Could we somehow 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246		
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	No , I wouldn't say so . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	No , it's not these days . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	I mean , it's quite easily accessible . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	That's good Yeah that a good idea . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	It lights up for 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	That , yeah , that's a good idea . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	On self timer . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	So self-timed lighting . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Alright we have five minutes left 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Um , I 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	um , for the meeting , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Um , what was 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	I missed the last moment , reading that . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	So , self-timed 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Okay , so 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	So 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	That's probably feasible . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	And I think that's un unique as well . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	I mean , I haven't seen that . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	durable . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	what's it called , R_S_I_ , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	what was it that we were talking about ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Oh right , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	the 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah instead of like hard buttons . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Okay . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	If 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Like should we do both ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Or we can have one or the other ? 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	I was gonna say , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Exactly . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	It the 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	and we could 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	So 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	which could like link in with the company colours . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Like it could be blue or green or yellow , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158		
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Alright . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So we've decided on lighting up things . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Mm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Or , or the , whate 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	But with the same thing , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	That's true . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Okay . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Is 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Are you okay with that ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Okay . Cool . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Alright . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	So I think that um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Is 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	And now it's up to designing . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	And um making sure that this can be feasible . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	What um 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	And do you have anything 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Oh sorry . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Do you have anything to say ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Oh yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Interchangeable thing ? 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Like an iPod or something ? 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	That would be good . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Exactly , like an iPod . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah , or 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Okay . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Exactly . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Okay . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Or , or like mobile ph . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Like a cellphone ? Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	But 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Y Could buy extra 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Accessories . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Exactly . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Person 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Yeah . Well , that's great . 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	That's a good idea . Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	I think that we should incorporate that . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Interchangeable . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Um , als 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	You'd just get one mould , 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	No . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Interchan 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	throw some plastic in it , you know . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	And also possible 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Oh yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Right . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301	But if we , there is 	
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	If w 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.303	We could 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Right . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	We'll have to do more research . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Yeah . 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Um , does it need to be reached a de 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? 	
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Um , I've 	
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Because we need to investigate the financial implications . 	
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301
