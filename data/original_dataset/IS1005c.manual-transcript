IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	So , uh 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	we will have again three presentation , from all of you , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So , who wants to start ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I s 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	No , no , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	you you can start . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay , I'll start . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So start , uh 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Can you open my presentation , 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	please . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I'm number four . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Trend . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	This one ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yep . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Can you pass the mouse , 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	please . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh okay , that's fine . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Turn . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Hmm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Hmm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	What does it mean , spongy ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Uh sort of um squishy . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um . Yeah soft , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Like soft , or something ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	like a uh like a sponge . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Like a sponge . Yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	I don't know . Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay . I will see . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And that it's easy to use 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . Um . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah , uh yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	That's it . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Easy to use , is it uh 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	It's less important , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	right ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Less important . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and half important as technology is easy to use . So . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So , Hamed , can you . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . The second one . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Could you please show the presentation number three . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um . Number ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	We'll see . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Three . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Three . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	This one ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Yes . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Uh , n n no , it's the first one . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	The second one . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So it's not this one . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It should be 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It should not be completely like uh a cube . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Exactly . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Not on remote control . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I dunno if I can explain well . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	But uh just inside . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So it can be another uh preference . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I know that it consumes lots of energy , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . That's mine . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I'm person two . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And which one , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	uh probably the first one . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I'm not sure 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	but check the first one . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	This one , yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , that's it . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Just 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	It's only this slide ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	or I'll just 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Inch . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Oh , . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	This is this is the stuff that I can use to 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Oops . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So there will be some circuit uh for the power . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So , say power circuit here . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	that we can uh uh 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So no problem . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	There can be also solar cell . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	So at least seven to seven . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	It depends where you put your screen , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	It doesn't matter . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So this will be T_F_T_ . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	say here . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Interface to the microphone . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	and the third unit is the I_R_ . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	so it will be very cheap for us . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	So infra-red here . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So the 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	once again the overall requirements , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	seven to seven centimetres for the board , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	which has to be 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	which can be spongy but has to be this size , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Um I have to check what I wanted to 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yep . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I dunno . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	maybe after . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	So 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Ca 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Can I ask a question . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	A Yeah , that's all from me . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	how big is it in reality ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Well , seven to seven inches . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So like that . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yes . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	That's quite big . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah but 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No , I don't think it's seven by seven , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	To be honest , I was 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	But I mean even even that is like this big . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah yes . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I dunno I dun I dun One each 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	. But , yeah , . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	but it's seven inches . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	But I I think we can we can cut it . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Let's go . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah , no no problem , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So let's cut the T_F_T_ . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Mm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay , 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	so 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	So so for the same price we have four screens now . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Mm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	These technical engineers , huh . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So , what's the size of the device ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Is it 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Can you hold that , or ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	What user wants . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	He wants a small remote control , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Uh . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	or ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh uh with big buttons . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yes . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	It's difficult . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	A sm 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	W I I think so . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Well , that's that's no task for me , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	but well seven to seven at least yeah , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So maybe you can finish your presentation , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	but 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	and afterwards we will discuss about all this . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Maybe this . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Oh , okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Okay thanks . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	That's it . Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	So . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	No . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Uh , so I think we have a lot 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	We have to take decision today , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Uh first I think energy it's a key problem 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Not 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	J uh just a point to the energy th things . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	so no problem in energy , I think . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	But we have to use the solar cell . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	So but 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Otherwise not . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh like 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	but using how many batteries , for example ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Uh one two 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So like three to five centimetres , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I dunno exactly , but . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	S 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	The television lights . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah from the T_ 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I don't think it's enough , uh . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I dunno . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	It's it's quite innovative , yes . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Uh what what are gonna be the size , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well what what would you guess as a shape ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Or what what would be the shape ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So let's say an average size , okay , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	and it should not be very heavy also . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So we c it's like like some joysticks . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So the general shape should be like this . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Which is the same area . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Could you re could you redesign your board ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Five to ten . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Well that 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah , right . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah , I think it's feasib 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Well one um um 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	How could we do it ? 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Oh . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So we are agree with a small 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	I'll make it . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Or uh or I don't know 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Fo Five by ten . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	L_C_D_ . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Touching the screen . Something like 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Tactile or something , yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm , touch screen . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Mm like tactile . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Touch screen , yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	because 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay , so 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	A smaller s 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	and I will work it out . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So , five by s ten . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Um so what about , so the case we talked about . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Um something easy to use , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Seven to ten banana . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	A big banana . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Rather mango or something or . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Um . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	But it's just an idea . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I dunno what you think about , but 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	I dunno if it can fit with the technology . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	You are the specialists of that . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	You mean banana . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Well , but 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	If it's If it 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	If the banana is big enough . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Then , yes . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	But if you want to look at the screen , no . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Well 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah , and 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	I think this is not good . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	The screen has to be square ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Well , it can be whatever you want . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	It could . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Well 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I'd like a shaped screen . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Okay 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Okay 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	But 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Like modified banana , okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So we are agree with the banana thing ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah , banana's good . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Okay . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Mm-mm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah , I think infra-red . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Everybody's agreed . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Sure . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I don't know what we are going to do with that . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	You talked about the buttons on the side 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Like like peeling of the banana you s 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah , peeling of the banana . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	It would be cool , yeah . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm what ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Peeling of the banana , you know , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	And you mean the first layer would be spongy . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	First layer obviously spo Yeah , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Is it is it possible to do that ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	It would be a great idea , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	but is it possible technically ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Uh 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , some 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So , something like this . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Well is it possible to make it soft ? 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	So I think if it's so then it's cool ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	So , I dunno what you think , Bob , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Cool . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123		
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	but it will be terrible . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Um . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Mm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	And setting buttons hidden in . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Mm , other remarks , or something , or . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	I think we are almost there . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	And how 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Pof . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	We could use Velcro . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Yeah , maybe . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Or uh ma maybe a magnetic 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yes , yeah it's a good idea . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	thing . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Magnetic . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Ma magnetic oh . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Mm . Yeah or a Yeah it can is 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	we cannot b uh 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So we need that the that the peeling 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	uh I dunno 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	but we should we should take care of these two two things . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	It is possible , but , well if it 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	And a and a banana . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Mm . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	I dunno . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Hmm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	But then it must be some window there , you know . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Okay . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Mm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	And something we forgot , maybe , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yes , I think . I think so . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	I think it's important . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Mm . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	And 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	and we have also the technology thing w will be . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	And even the easy to use thing , 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	so it will be perfect . 	
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Mm . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	So we add also the speech recognition device . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	I agree . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	So , that great . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	We have decided everything . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	And think we are on a good way . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
IS1005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	And uh , yeah , I 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	and uh more about the shape and so on 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	and how you can manage to put everything together . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	So thank you all everybody , 	
IS1005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . 	
IS1005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	and see you in thirty minutes . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
IS1005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Thank you .
