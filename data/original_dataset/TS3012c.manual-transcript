$d@nite:id	$d	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Did you manage ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Yeah , sh not quite . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	You will see uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Ah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Hello . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Hello . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	So , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	are you d 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	what were j you guys discussing ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	No , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	just uh ask if if he could manage . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Woah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Did you find anything new ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Mm uh nothing special . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	I have a lot of new information . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yeah , the for uh the trendy uh stuff . A little bit . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Great , great . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Come on . . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I uh now will show it . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Hey , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	everything alright . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I had just a little bit of time , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Did you manage ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	so I hope it's something uh we can work with . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	What's uh here . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	But 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	I had the same . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	It just uh shuts itself down 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Do you have a lot of new information ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Hmm ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Do you have a lot of new information ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Oh . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	which was pretty much up to standard , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	That's true . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	And there we are . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Huh . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	so we might use that 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I put that in my drawing , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	but again I didn't not have that much time . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Alright . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	I have a lot of new information . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	What the f 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	oh , yeah uh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use , all the components that all av available . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	It doesn't do what I want it 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I have no 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	that's just super . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Let me just 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	I still don't have any finance information , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	but at least we have a lot more to go on now 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	. 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Okay fine , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	that's too bad . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	You need to start it up first ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Yeah , I have to start our 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	'Kay . Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	go again . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	second phase , conceptual design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	So , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Yep . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	take you past the minutes of last meeting again . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So Here we go . Anyway , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	last w last w what discussed last time , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Same goes for you . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So we have to make a move on that area , I guess . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	S 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product , we'll be fine . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Anyways , well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	teletext wasn't important 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	and that's what I took . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And the consumer , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	we aim for young consumers , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	so that's fine . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	And well actually we yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	we did need some more data on finances , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm uh-huh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	That's too bad . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	we need to im de 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	So anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I'll just close this one now , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and let's uh let's see , . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Okay , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	I bet 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	what t 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	We have a lot to tell . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	You had a lot to go on . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	So uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	how about you go first . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yep , that's right . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Oh okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Let's see where my presentation is . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Okay , um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	this I mentioned before . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	We need to take care of that . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Then warning , uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	uh scroll-wheel , and L_C_D_ is an advanced . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Of course this is more expensive than this . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So we have to decide on that in a minute . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	The available uh components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an uh dynamo , like in uh old torches . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	We have a kin uh kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	And we have solar cells . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Then I have all lists . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	because uh I ha 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Does it provide enough energy ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	I think so , yes . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yes . Yes . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	that's the just assume it takes . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	So then it's already shaken and gives energy . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I'm not sure if it's shaken enough , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Is that enough ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	. Or 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	because 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	No , I don't think so , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	because uh watches can go on kinetic energy 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Think 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	because they move all the time . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	But I'm sure t 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	So I don't think that's a really good 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	the other alternative were solar cells . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I don't think that's applicable 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	because 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	No . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	I thin why 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	And what does the hand dynamo 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	why shouldn't we take a basic battery ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	oh , sorry . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	A rechargeable maybe . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Only basic battery ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Why not ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	but I think this is not a r 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Re rechargeable basi 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	. 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	It's it's common . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and it's available everywhere . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	So why sh mm I think better . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	but it's 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options , a rechargeable m module actually . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Oh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Huh ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	that's uh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Okay ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Okay yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Yep . Basic . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	b you c 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	But that's up to the consumer himself . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	That's what it says . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	mm 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	it's not in the list . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So we cannot choose from it . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Exactly . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Okay , will just take regular batteries . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Alright . Right . Yep . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Next one is curving . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	And uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Curves being ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	uh th uh the shape . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Of the remote control itself , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Exactly . Yes . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	But But It dep But 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	I was thinking along the line of one curve . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I'll show that in my design . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Okay , we'll get back on that later . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	we'll get back to that . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Just 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	But what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Depends on the user . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	More expensive . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	More difficult to make . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Exactly . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Also decreases , okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	exactly . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Material . I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Uh if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	If we choose titanium , uh we cannot use more than one curve . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	But we don't have that so fast . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	More than one curve , uh yeah okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Okay , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I t 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	We'll just go uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	I'd go for plastic 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	because I have a couple of curves in my design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	'Cause it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	I'm not sure . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Mm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Mm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	g 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	let's just get back to that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	We'll discuss that later . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	we have 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	so I think we can rule out um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	I'm not sure we can rule anything out . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	We'll do that when y when you get your design . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	No . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	But I think wood is not an option either . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	No , wood's not an option . No . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	No , wood i wood's not an option . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Well 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	it it's stylish , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	but we can 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	but you can change your covers anyway . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	No . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	My personal thought was uh rubber 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	because I had an email , I believe it was from you , uh f against falling . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	remote controls fall a lot on the ground . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	So you don't want it to break . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	So either have rubber edges 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	or a rubber remote control is very durable . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Okay . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	But 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Continue . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	but it doesn't have to be unbreakable , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	No . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	because we do need to keep selling these thing 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Don't have to be un-breakable , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	it's p it's a 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	it's not supposed to ju yeah , break after one use . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Mm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Okay , well 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	I mean it they 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	that that's definitely true . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	they fall a lot . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Uh because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	We have no more than this . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Because it 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	ru 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Because it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	you have for if you if 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	And rubber uh kind of softens the fall . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but then you buy a new cover . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	But rubber 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Uh , it's could be . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Are are we focussi focussing on on the 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	You know what , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	th 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	we're focusing very much on the covers now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	But But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	But I think the basic thing 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	let's just rule out wood for now 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	and continue . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Not that 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	We're definitely focussing on the younger people , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Younger , okay . Yeah , that's okay . Nah , that's 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	'cause that was our main goal . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Alright . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Then I proceed , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	but I need to know after this meeting . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Okay okay , we will . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Interface , uh I have four things to offer , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	pu 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history , our company , on push-buttons . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Scroll-wheels , uh those can be pushed as well , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	although that is more expensive . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Um liquid crystal colour display 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	and um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	What is this ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	So rubber can only match with rubber . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Which one of those are we gonna use ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Evident . Yeah , o of course we're gonna use . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Huh . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	of cour 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	No . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Maybe for volume control . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	I think the channels . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Channel , I think that would be annoying 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Oh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	I think a push-button for channel would be better . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	. 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	I mean it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Huh ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Huh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	you can just increase or decrease . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	But not sure . For channels will be good . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Hmm . But 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	but there is a 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	is it really necessary 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	'cause a normal push-button can do that job . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	I don't think so . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Huh ? Oh . Ah so 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	But th the younger people 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	but it looks cool . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	I don't think we really need one . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm no . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Oh . Ah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	flashy and 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	. 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	I think would be cool , scroll-wheel . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	So A sc 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	It's not that much 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	We can do that . Think . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	But why do we need it ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	but why would we use it ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Ah we don't need it , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	but it's uh it's design a design thing . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	If we don't need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	you get 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	No . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	I think they are looking for that . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Of course we have uh a young target group . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Are they ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	So they might find that attractive in a remote con 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Scroll-wheel ? Uh I don't know . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	but if it's if it's not useful , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yeah , that's it . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Anyway 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	So push-buttons we will use . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Uh L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Perhaps . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I have t I have two different 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Is that s 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	What you what 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Is it expensive ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Does it 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Uh I only know that if we are using that , we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	And that is more expensive . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	And how much more expensive is that ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Or 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	No absolute numbers , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	I only have 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	. 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	but it's just more expensive 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	and takes more room I suppose in your in your design . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	but I don't think room is really an issue . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Don't think it's an issue , okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Oh let's go for 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	. 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I have two designs , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	one including uh an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	For the future . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yep 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Exactly . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	But we'll 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	We'll pick a we'll pick from uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	we'll just combine everything later . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Electronics , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	uh the first one is the chip . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Uh that's no longer an option , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	it has to be an advanced one now . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Yep . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Then we have an infrared sender , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	I think that's basic , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	we cannot do without . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Basically , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yep . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	it 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Otherwise it's not s a remote control . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Are we gonna do that or not ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Oh , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I got 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	but apparently you don't have any data . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	I only have uh uh relative information . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	I got an email that it's relatively small . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	That's small . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	So we can implement it . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yes , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	let me just Get back . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	So why why 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Oh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	how did you 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	And there's um get your mar marketing report ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	That goes also for the scroll-wheel , by the way . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	What was uh the last number 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	of how many people were interested in voice recognition ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Although it's hard for different countries of course . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	The most of them um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Um uh more than uh sixty percent . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Mean of uh seventy percent I think . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Uh I'm 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	I have to look it up . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	If it's small , if it's fits , if if people like it , why not ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	So 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	No . No , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	That's strange , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	because that's the same story . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	only 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Ah . I don't know . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	but it's just it adds something to the design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	On the most spee 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	No 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	But 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Oh that's r 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Uh I think so , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	So it's m 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	because if I think we're specially w if you're going 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	for the future . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out , probably you have one with uh with speech recognition 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	and 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	they b 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	they basically can have speech recognition . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Um Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	hold on a minute . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Were were you 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	we're finished ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Or 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	No , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	but that's that's okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Oh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Because if there's something that 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	'Cause you wanted to see them , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	There is still time . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	'Cause have 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	right ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	did you have all the materials ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Or everything that you desc 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yes , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	this was uh the last M_S_ . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	I have a clear picture . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Okay , so uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	just just go for design for now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Just m have a seat for a second . Uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	We'll combine everything after this . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	So this is basically the deluxe edition . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Why is it s why is it squared ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I j 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Why is it square ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Why did you pick square ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Or uh not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	It 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	'cause it's designy . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	It's basically it has some futuristic Potentially , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	I don't really know . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	People 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Looks like a Star Trek phaser . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	It's true . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Ri 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	which you can put your finger in . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Yeah . Or Okay , so just yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So only r right-handed . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	you can rest it on your finger . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So you can you can hold it really comfortable , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	that's basically the idea . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	But it but it's only right-handed then . Not for the left . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Or left hand . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	No , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	it just uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Or 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	I 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	doesn't really matter . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	it's a curve inside a thing . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	As you can see , this is the remote control 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Where ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Wher 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	It's on the back . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Oh in the back , okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Uh you can't really see it that well , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Oh yeah yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	but this is the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So just imagine it goes that way . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah , I think it's okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Oh yeah yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	And I also made a quick image , 'cause I did not have that much time , of the standard edition 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I thought it 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	which has basically the keys are pretty much the same . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	I had to do this really fast . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Okay . Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	but as you can see , the keys moved . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	these are basically the two types we have . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	But 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	So it would that would give us a totally different design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Well 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	we can shift that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here , we had to move them downward , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah , uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	so what you could say is that 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Because these are basically the functions you use the most . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Well 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	it it's 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	this is the m most easy part . Bit . For zapping , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Hmm , I agree . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	That's fine . That's fine . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	cau 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	because people are zapping most of the time . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Uh , okay 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	if you all agree , I'm fine with it . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	But 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Okay . So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	which is the design thingys . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	No 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	it 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	So I can uh show my uh investigation . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	I think we'll 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	because that seems to be what the people want . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah , maybe it's better . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	But let's see what's what they want now . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Especially for young people . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Um where is that ? Where is th 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	That's mine . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Oh . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	No , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	you should send it to the f to the folder first . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Mm I forgot that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Okay um , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	let's just assume we go to forty one . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	now it must be there . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah , here it is . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Oh yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Okay , uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	So that's the L_C_D_ screen is perfect , I think , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	and not uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Speech recognition . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah , tha that's uh very important . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	And a third thing is um yeah , it's uh should be easy to use , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	And what the pe young people want is uh in Paris and and in Milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Th they 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	you s you see it in the clothes and everything . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	And um the contrast uh of it , it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	So uh rubber , I think uh th that's the best . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	No . Yeah , uh I agree . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	No . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	I think so . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	So we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	If that is the uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Okay , agreement . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	so we're definitely going for rubber . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	It could be a c it could be a cover . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	But it's not . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Our focus is the young audience . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Let's just go 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	but 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	So let's stick to that . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Uh-huh . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	'Cause uh n I I I I thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Nah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	I think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	because we're that's what we're focussing on . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	that's why I I d uh decided With a fruit uh cover ov or something like that . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	apparently 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	maybe also 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	. 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit , maybe . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	for exa 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	maybe like uh like a pear or something . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	but that's just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	And 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Oh , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	where is your 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	That's true . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	That's what we're doing . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	A trendy 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	Mm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	I think shape is is important , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	But not 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Here he here you can put a 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	because they s they really extend . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Oh , that's true . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	And then you have your apple-shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	So I think that's more something you can focus 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	So I I th the edges are really really sharp . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	you can s 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Uh maybe it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	I'm uh not su 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	But that will bring extra c expenses . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	But 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	All uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	So it's better 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	I think I think there needs to be a little 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	The bottom is fine of course if it's square . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	But maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	So I mean y 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	That would be two curves . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Two ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	We have one left and one right , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	and that disables what was it again ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	But it 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	It's some it's something that we cannot do then . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	One cur 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	you could also make the curve go through of course . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	But that would make make the top round . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Well 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	we've got we've got like one curve here . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	that's not a problem . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	For the gap . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	That's only for the titanium . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	We don't have . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	But it's that 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	that's for the comfort . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	And we could have one here . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	It's it's not for the trendy thing of it . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	No , no no no no . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	What I'm just 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	so I'm just taking that into account . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Yeah ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yes 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	But let's see , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	titanium would give us only one curve . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Then w 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	but we don't have that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	but we're not d we're not using titanium . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	So we have 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	So the no . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	We have no . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Well 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	we picked rubber , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	right ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Right , we did . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	But they uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	We m 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Just doodle something on the board on the left . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	form . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	We were looking at something fresh , something trendy 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	Well actually , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	So that 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	let's see what you're doing . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	They th 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	these wha are what they call the curves . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	This side , this side , this is how they count . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	Oh , okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	No no . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	This is what they uh what they mean . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Okay , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Okay , that's not really a good . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	so that's basically silly . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	now I uh of course now I understand why they have more uh like um Why the curves um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	It's like this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	I think it's for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	if you see what 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	So 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	because we 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Hey , you 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	because lot of things we came up with , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	You can make it like Like this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	because it's kind of an idea of our own , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	No , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	but 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	but we're not sure if we can actually make that . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Because it that's just for one seasonal trend . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Oh . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	As a example . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I d 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Okay , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	so that's 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	that's probabl 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	M 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	just round it off a little , I guess , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	because so we have more options I suppose . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	, you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	I think so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	because it looks leaner 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	and we should just go with that . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382	Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	So So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	we decided on what 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	what did you guys wanna know again 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	because this is um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	anyway , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	I'll fire up my thing . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.389	So so 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Did you present e everything you wanted to ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.390	we come to a decision . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Yep . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	I can uh qui 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.391	Uh what the 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	oh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.392	Ah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.393	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.394	Okay , anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.395	Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.396	The chip is advanced 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	because we have the advanced features . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	Uh user interface , type . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	Well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	I think we took all the components separately what we want . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.403	Um let's see um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.404	supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.405	Anyway , um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.406	apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.407	So Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.408	you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . Yeah 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.409	So Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.410	of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.411	So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.412	Wanna spend some more 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.413	um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.414	which is good . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.415	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.416	Lef 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.417	let's see , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.418	where the pen go ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.419	Here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.420	Yeah uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.421	open your thing again . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.422	Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.423	Um I'll just do a next one . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.424	So what would give us your ne your design would be 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.425	the lights would be on top , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.426	right ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.427	Uh one on each one on each side . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	To create a kind of disco effect 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	when you 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	That was basically what w 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.428	Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Light for the finding of the remote . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.429	or lights that it that 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.430		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.431	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.432	I think that should just be a simple LED or something . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.433	Like that 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.434	that's not that important of course . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.435	It just like a matter of a noise] a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.436	So I don't think that's super important . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.437	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.438	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	So we have the teletext we have here , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	we have the mute . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.439	Uh sh Oh . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	This is the on off button . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	And speech w recognition . Are we 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Speech recognition , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	I 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	We Little uh voice uh Record and a uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	where did I imagine . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	I did that pretty much over here , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	so that you could use it like this and speak to it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	no . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	We can also just not use them . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.440	Let's see , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.441	I'll just make 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Main controls and a key-pad . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.442	One light here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.443	And just make it red now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.444	But it could be any colour . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.445	So 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Will be fine . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.446	Okay , whatever . Fine , anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.447	What do we have here ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.448	M I'll make it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.449	um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.450	Personally I would prefer round ones . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Me too . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	but that would 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Form of fruit . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	this was just in the design . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	It's better . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Because if you 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.451	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	I had a square design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.452	for 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	So I had square buttons . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.453	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.454	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.455	I assume it for 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.456	so we take a r take a round power button right here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.457	Whatever . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.458	Uh back to black . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.459	Uh not too big though . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.460	See this would be good . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.461	Um let's see . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.462	Are these for any extra controls ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	The left one is teletext 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.463	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.464	Okay . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	and the right one is mute . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	And these two buttons are or not necessary 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	or 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.465	If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.466	if you 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.467	let's see , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.468	put it this here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.469	I think we'll go with the triangles 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.470	that 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.471	Come on . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.472	Triangles are good . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.473	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.474	they're a little too big now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.475	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.476	Anyway , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.477	okay . So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.478	do you want for example a round button in the middle or square one ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	but 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.479	I'm not sure uh , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.480	I just just came up with it . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.481	This aligns nicely . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.482	So Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.483	We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.484	sorry . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Does everybody agree on that ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.485		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yep . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.486	I suppose so . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	I would prefer round . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	But doesn't matter , doesn't matter . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	You prefer a round ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.487	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	That's not a big deal , think . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.488	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.489	there's our numbers . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.490	Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the higher numbers . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.491	And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose . For something else , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.492	just to mirror mirror the effect with this . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah , you can . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194		
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	But it but it's not necessary , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	becau 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.493	That's not necessary 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.494	because it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.495	you can take this away , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.496	but there it looks like there's a hole there , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.497	just to mirror the effect . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.498	Okay , so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.499	we have a few 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	We could put our logo there . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.500	Nah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.501	I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.502	We could put a logo here 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.503	because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	And what about 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Oh . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	What about a button for your uh favourite channel ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Oh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	that could be that b 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.504	Well 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.505	we could we could include either here or here , for example . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Uh yeah . With the extra controls . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.506	But you think here or here ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Well 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Uh one one set 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.507	I know . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	So Is your 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	you have to put it up uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.508	No , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.509	we could put this one as favourite channel for exam 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Because 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	One of the four . Uh , it's better than , I think . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.510	What are these for ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	One of the four is better , I suppose . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.511	Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	It's a favourite channel . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.512	What ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	What ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Nee , uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	one of the four uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	It's better th 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.513	You're accustomed to eleven ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.514	My uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.515	okay , have it your way . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.516	I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Oh , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	we still need an okay button . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.517	I mean why wouldn't you include a 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.518	'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.519	So why not give it a function . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Hmm . Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.520	Let's say I mean could be anything . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.521	But th 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.522	No , I don't think 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.523	because this is a zero . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.524	But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.525	Anyway , so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.526	this is the basic design , we wanna have 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.527	um on and off 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.528	what are we missing ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Oh , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.529	If it looks um 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	we're pretty much missing an okay button , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	but we have a button up there which is still free . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.530	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.533	so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.531	what I'm gonna draw . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.532	So Um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.534	probably think you want the curve to be here . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Yeah , pretty much . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.535	Just gonna be sh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.536	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.537	Want this straight or what ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.538	Let's keep it at this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.539	So it would be like this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.540	Do we want something interesting with it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.541	or 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.542	see . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.543	Would give us a light here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.544	Maybe it's boring . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.545	You want it curved or what ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.546	Maybe you want 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I think it looks better curved . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.547	Should like this ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	But that's probably uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.548	Will give us design problem 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Mm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Huh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.549	because we have 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	It can be curved . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Why ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	It can be curved , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	because that 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Yes . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	it's a little bit more trendy to be curved . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.550	It can be curved . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.551	Okay ? I think so . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.552	That's why I asked you . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.553	Okay . So 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	I would curve the whole actually . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Hmm ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I would curve the whole . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.554	Oh crap . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Then it will bounce 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	and you don't drop it so easily . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.555	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.556	Oh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.557	Anyway , so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.558	you want to a little more like this ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah , something like that , yes . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Uh-huh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.559	And just s s 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Yes , exactly . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.560	Stop the curve here 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.561	or continue it 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	I think continue like that . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yep . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Then there's also enough room for the electronics . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.562	So we have our L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.563	Let's see . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	But it pretty much looks like a banana already . Uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.564	In 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Let's make it yellow then . Uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Perfect . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.565	Bana 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.566	it's banana vision . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	It's fruit . Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	it's perfect . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.567	So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.568	Um that would make 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.569	We use the colours now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.570	But Um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.571		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Have ourselves sponsored . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.572	You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.573	So it would give the buttons here . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Or they can design their own cover . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	They might wanna be the first ones to uh 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	We could set up a a marketing uh agreement . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.574	I suppose I suppose we can put 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.575	um let's see . Um 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Oh , perhaps they can use it . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Or give a special edition 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	uh with with 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.576	Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.577	because it has the most space , for example . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.578	I don't think so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.579	because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Mm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.580	Let's 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	I think this is possible . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.581	I think it's possible . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.582	I think it's the best place 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.583	yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.584	you could also put 'em here . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Huh . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.585	But 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	It doesn't matter . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	and and wire it . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Doesn't matter . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.586	Okay , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Okay , that's not a problem . Okay . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.587	so we put the batteries here . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.588	That's fine . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.589	Yep . Blah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	I think we get the idea . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.590	Um , any other com what 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.591	what are we missing here ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.592	Something 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.593	a speech recognition . Um 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.594	where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the or , for example , on top ? Like here . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Top ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Oh , basically 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	W 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	On there . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	I think on top . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.595	To be 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	'Cause you can talk to it like this . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.596	Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.597	I w thought maybe it's either be here or 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	No . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.598	because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.599	I'm not sure . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.600	But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.601	'Cause transmitter would be here . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	the email said it was a quite a small component . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	So I don't see that . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.603	Why uh 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.604	once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.605	Anyway . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.606	Um yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.607	it could be either be here 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.608	or make a double microphone . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.609	I wouldn't mind . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	. 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.610		
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	It is , I believe , also able to talk . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.611	It's able to talk to you . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	It's a 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.612	A speaker sensor . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Uh the speaker sensor we already have , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	I think it can . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	the 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.613	I think so , it I think it could . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.614	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.615	I mean it could be a 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.616	all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.617	which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Hmm . But 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.618	If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	but do you actually need the remote talking back ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.619	I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.620	because you don't have to have a button for everything . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.621	You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	. 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.622	Think that would be fine . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Mm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.623	So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.624	Mm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.625	Beep . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	beep . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Beep . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Beep . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.626	Um , so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.627	the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.628	We could 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.629	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.630	but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	At the back , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	yeah . Like that . Or at the side . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.631	For 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Which is . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.632	how do you draw that again ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.633	Uh whatever , looks stupid . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	So what's basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.634	I think this is pretty 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	We need to stay here and work out that . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	I'm not sure . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.635	I think you have to stay here 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Oh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	I should be getting new information , I guess . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.636	because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.637	Oh , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.638	like my 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.639	the info that I got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.640	because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yep . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.641	I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So the project report . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.642	Hmm . Okay , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.643	I think we're 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Well , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	I suppose we'll 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.644	everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Yes . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.645	So we're s supposed to be rubber . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Ah , that's fine . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Pretty much . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.646	I think 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.647	well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.648	I think the the remote control is gonna be black 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Round . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.650	because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Wh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Why ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.651	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.652	we have the logo up there . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	But we have 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	any company logo . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.653	So are we gonna 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.654	base colour is black ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	We have 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	yes , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	but 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	and yellow . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.655	And yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.656	of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	I would change 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	. I would take a yellow remote control . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.657	Yellow 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.658	but yellow control . It's 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	To have it flashy , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	to have it 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	it's for young people . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.659	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Need do be different . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	It's the colour of a 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.660	Well , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.661	don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.662	But don't stick yourself on the cover 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.663	because 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	No , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	we're designing the remote control now , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	but taking that into consideration , it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	But we need to be different . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.664	Nah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.665	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.666	but the info . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.667	I think we should go with uh with the company colour 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	But , the you 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.668	because what specific info that I got from the project board . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.669	So I think we should go with that . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	The young people want uh a trendy uh remote control . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.670	They want something trendy . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	So colourful uh is 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Huh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	It is more trendy . That's definitely true . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.671	I think we should th 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	To be different . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.672	then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.673	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.674	let's see if if we can do the LED onto it . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.675		
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	You have the basic colours , blue , green , red . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.676	Uh oh . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	we have so many colours already . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.678	You know what ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Oh , it's okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.679	I'm not gonna do this . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Oh no , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	that 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.677	That's up to you guys . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	I think it's good thing to be different 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	than 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.680	You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Colourful , you you 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Well Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.681	we'll be done . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.682	I think we're all happy now . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Yep . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.684	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.683	Stupid scroll-wheel . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	Uh that's 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Oh , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	where would you like to put it ? 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Yeah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Nah , that's true . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.685		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.686	'Kay 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.687	I'm not sure uh I really , I'm no 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.688	I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	No , forget it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Oh yeah . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	But it's has no real added value . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	No look , 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	You can 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.689	It takes space , a lot of space . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	No , that's not my point . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.690	And it could 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	It's not because it's functional , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	but it's just to add to the design , to have it flashy . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Ah 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	It it has no function , I agree . I agree . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	may 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	but if it has no function , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.691	I'm not sure 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	then 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.692	if it if it has no function , why even put it there ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	Oh , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	so many things have no function , just design . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.693	And th that's just so much things that make it look flash 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	But uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Mm-hmm . Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.694	I think channel selection would be annoying 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Ma 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.695	because it just c you could scroll past the channel 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.696	or 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Let's vote on it . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Oh okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.697	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Oh okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	What do you want ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	In 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	or out ? 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Basically out . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	I don't see the 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	Okay . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	You are out of course . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.698	. 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	You are 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Out . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	okay , clear . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.699	No r no scroll-wheel . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.700	Okay . Um 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.701	I don't see anything missing really . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.702	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Do you have all your answers ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.703	we should 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.704	too bad we don't have the finance . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	I have all my answers , yes . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.705	We could've 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.706	Yeah , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.707	it's 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.708	I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.709	because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	I have to call this in a form . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.710	I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	There is 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	I have one question . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.711	So you just do whatever you like 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.712	and uh doesn't care what it costs . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	I only have one question with the material , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	but I don't have information that . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	We've chosen rubber . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.713	I think we're 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.714	rubber is not expensive . Definitely . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	No , 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	but can we make yellow rubber ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	I think so 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.715	You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . 	
TS3012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Ah . 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.716	So 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.717	I mean you can't make yellow titanium , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.718	but you can make yellow rubber . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	But we ha w 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	Mm . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover ? 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	Okay . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.719	Uh yeah 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	No , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.720	we can make uh 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	huh ? 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.721	for example it's just something you can click on it 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.722	like uh that's but it's not som not 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.723	apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Maybe maybe later , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.724	So . 	
TS3012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	maybe we can uh 	
TS3012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	Hmm . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.725	Yeah , it could be . 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.726	It can be done , 	
TS3012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.727	for e
