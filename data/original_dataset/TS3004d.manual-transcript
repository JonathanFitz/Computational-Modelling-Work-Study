TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Oh . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	It's not saved yet . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	So 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Our beautiful drawing . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	So just f um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So this is our agenda . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	You're 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Oops . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Uh I didn't 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So these are the 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Oh , okay . Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	So these are the um last notes we I made . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I don't have to put it in the report . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Are we doing the the speech recognition ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So if you want to , it's okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay , just 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	but it should be uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yeah , and 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Or fold open ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I don't know . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	It's probably better . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Maybe that's better . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah , that's that's a very good point . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Think that's better . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So this is okay ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	No . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	so that's 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	The 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	But um 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay , for the 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Ah okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So it's okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Good . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So you can show your prototype if you want to . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Together ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah , it's Let's do it together . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I'll give comments . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Uh the look-and-feel model . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Simply a square with uh round corners . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So that's basically it . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh the material should be hard plastic . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	And colour and transparent , or just transparent , 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I don't know . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Um then the elements . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Uh we have 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	The functions are just basic . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Like uh I've pointed them here . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mute function , on-off function , text functions . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	This uh switch channel . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay , cool . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	And this is the 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	the num-pad . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	And the logo is over here , and the mic . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And the scrollwheel , no ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	You operate that with your pointing finger . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Means 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So you hold it like this in your right hand and 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Speech recognition . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah , speech recognition . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Just 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Only one button to say it's on or off . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh I dunno . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Um so I've 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	That's uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	But 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah , you can put it separate . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	You 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah I know . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	But it's enough room . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um the position ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah , you write uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Uh well 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	You wrote this , so . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	That was the the most important thing . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So uh the best place , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	the best reach place 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Just just one thing now . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um y you need to have more uh one two th 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay yeah , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	they 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Mm yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	That's that's below that then . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	It's uh twelve buttons . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	just so you get that . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay , but It's rather important . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah okay , just we just missed that . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	But um I'll just uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	I'll get back to later . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So um should be popular . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Um 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	The f uh the buttons creating ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Uh if you 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Colour changeable . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So when you pre 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	How do you want to implement that ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Just on the 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	We're going to implement . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Maybe on the second level as well ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm just a little 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Ah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah , these are just basic functions , so 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	All the non-basic are in 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	That function must be 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Okay , maybe we use this button for the 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , maybe 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah , as well . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Just make make a 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	To your video device . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	A second level ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	No no , just on Down there . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Is i Ah okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	And h how does the second level come out ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Just uh if you s 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh it slides uh along ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um slides I think . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It's 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	From from the uh beneath ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	For the bottom . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	You can do it that it claps open , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	but I think that's not solid enough . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	No , you gotta slide it . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	If that breaks then you're screwed . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah , it's right . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Um 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	So what do we need ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Uh i the the speech functions buttons . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	just 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Menu ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Menu button . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	With uh maybe uh arrows . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So you can uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	scroll in the , navigate the menu . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Um 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	God damn it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Scart ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I think we can even put a 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Uh yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So you have one left for the 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So this is the 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	It's a f basic uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Extern or something . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	That was it . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So here are multiple speech buttons , 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I don't know how many . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Doesn't really matter . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I don't know the functions . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Just just uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	It doesn't really matter . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	That's 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah well we don't have any uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	What else ?

TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	That's that's very easy , yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	We can put those here . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Colour buttons . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And then we choose green , uh blue and red or 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yep .

TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I just uh The volume logo . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	No , ma on on o on the on the 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	there's one there's one text button I 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oh wh Here ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Just make it 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	There's one text button I prefer . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah , or th or the 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , we have that on the the text button . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Do you do you 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Did you think of that ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yep . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Uh why not ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Ex Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	No 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Well w we thought of a text button . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Whoa 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And if you press it again , you get the the the 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I think um 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	The sta the state you 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Oh just three stages , 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	through view . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	you 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , the three stages . Yes . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah , that's okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	So you can switch back from second to w first . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	No , it doesn't have to turn it off . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	No . Just remember where it was . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Just don't 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yes , that's to remember . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay , okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah , but that's that's uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	But maybe it's not the way 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I dunno if 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	That's a functionality for the television . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah mm nee uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	No , if i 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	in thi the the remote control in the 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , but you have to search every time again . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Th i 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	the chip . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	That's what what happening if you do it like that . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	But it's still the television that has to do that . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah , I dunno . Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Um do we need to fix that or 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	No , that's what the television does . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah , those memory functions . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	But uh not not every every television , so 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay , it's cool . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Was uh this logo for uh volume ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah , that's fine . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	So that's it ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah , I I thought about one thing . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Mm . No no 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Just like your telephone , hard plastic . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . Just hard plastic . So 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	are uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I think just on the buttons . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Uh I think just um 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Well yeah . That's too much place . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah , but 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I don't think the space is worth it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , and i 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	The most time 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . Fine . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah ? Okay , cool . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Mm mm mm mm mm . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah , I don't know what this means . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	But I think we just evela evaluated this one . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I d d d I don't think if it's right . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	That shall show it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	You have some usability criteria or 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Oh . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	In the bottom . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Look-and-feel ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Evaluation crit 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	No , evaluation is 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah , evaluation presentation . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	It's not in . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh d it doesn't matter um 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It only had two pages or something . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	The Italians uh , how they think about it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I made some criteria , 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	um model . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And this 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	It's 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yes . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	We are actu We are the 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Flashy . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Well I think we do 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	The LEDs . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yes . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	But uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Hmm ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Or you haven't thought about 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Um basic colours , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	um yeah . Well you didn't say . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Ho how do we make uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Maybe um company colours ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	It's black . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Black and yellow . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Black . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , yellow light . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	A bit a bit of yellow . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Can 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Do we have yellow light ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	No , not really , but it's possible . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	It's 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Black white , maybe ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Like white , also ni or uh always nice . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	And what colours should the buttons be ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Because um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah , different colours . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	This is 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Just um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Oh , the same as th th the cover . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	But also th the light behind it . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	But can you change those too , with uh the switch ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yes . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	No , no . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Make them 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	No , just make them black or grey or something . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Well we have changeable fronts , so 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	just give it a one . It's okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	It's perfect . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I think it's just what you want . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Or not ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	It's hard to decide for us , but yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . It's ju so subjective . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	It it's 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Okay , just give it a two . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	A two . Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	The fancy look-and-feel . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	One more thing . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	So 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Are w are we changing uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Or n no back light ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Slide panel ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Mm . Not needed . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah , not needed I think . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	and uh 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Oh , you mean th this here ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	That as well , yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah , but that's unnecessary . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	What do I think is necessary necessary item ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Of course it's reachable . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It doesn't make 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Then we do it . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Hmm . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	So you can see what's really there . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Not just not re on the buttons or something . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	No . Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Just a green light or some blue light . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	To light it all up . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	But Yeah . Mayb Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	but 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah , just backlight . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Not not the buttons . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So the buttons are just grey . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , that's how I think . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	So I'll give it a 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Ye 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah , this It is a one . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	It's okay . It's cool . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I think it's one . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay , next . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Learnable ? Easy to use ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , we shall test it 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	But uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It's That's 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	No , but you don't have to use that . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	No . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So I think it's easy to use , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	but 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	And learnable is a bit 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Learnable ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Well , I think it is . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Well y just uh f 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Uh then the re 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	But the rest of it is very easy , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	because there are so so n 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yes . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	But 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	It's Yeah it's 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Device . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	But 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Because easy to use comes after learnable . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	I I think it a three or something . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	so just give it a two . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Maybe three then . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Learnable's 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm uh . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	The normal . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah okay . Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yep , true . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Then a two . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Oh . Okay . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	New features . Techno technological innovative ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	The speech function and the colour . Colour . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	The speech function is new . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	The scrollwheel 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Slide is not n is is not new . No . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	I already have a 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	So that's not new . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Okay , and the the the lightning ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	That's cool . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Is that new ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	for a Uh for a f 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	The lighting's new . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm it's pretty new , I think . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yes . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Scrollwheel . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Speech ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Speech is new . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Different colours , so 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So we have a pretty new uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	That would 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	And we didn't uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	But then we also have the the home station . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	If you have 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	We are forgetting about that now , but 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Uh-oh . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Home-station . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	We don't 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	recharge . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	But that's more like uh now . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , just draw it afterwards . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	I don't know . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	If you 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Just save , save as ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Uh save as ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	No , that's not in the project . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Oh yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Smart board . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah , but this one . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	This one is not yet in the 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Oh oh . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I think it is . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198		
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah , it is . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	No , I think it is . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Uh untitled ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah , it doesn't matter . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Save . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	No , we are not extraordinary new or something . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	But not 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	No , just so it's still a two . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Tha tha that 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm two , I think . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	N 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Targeted audience . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Uh we are the targeted audience ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Do we like it ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	No , 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah , but l younger than forty . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yes . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	So we we are exactly the targeted group . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Th that's my question . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	I think so , yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	So you want 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	think that's a two or a one . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And I don't thi I don't see 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah , this . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	So we targeted it ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	But we didn't follow the latest trends . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	No . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah , you could make a a front 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah , you get different colours . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	You can different front uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	So 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Like a a f banana kind of front . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Oh yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	But spongy will never be . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	No . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So we give ourself a three or something . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Oh . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	So that's eleven . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	That's uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	What's the average ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	It's 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Eleven divided by six . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah , it is one point eight three . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	A perfect score . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	No , I don't know . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	We're not too hard on ourselves . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	To call . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Oh yeah , that's still 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Call 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	That's Yeah , but it 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	No no , I want that in . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	If you do uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	right ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	It's uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	So I just got a financial um 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yes uh . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	You s saved it or 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . I did save it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	No . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	If I forgot anything , just say it to me . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	It just is a battery . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	But okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Mm okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	That's fine . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	But uh is uh uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	So that's both . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah , and single curved curved . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	No , that's not on the list . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	But that shouldn't be . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yeah , we can uh 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Probably . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	I just 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	I'm not sure . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	See it's 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	I think it's okay like this . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Special form , yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	It's hard to say . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	But maybe we have to um 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	We get different ones , that's all . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	So you can put a recharger in it as well . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	But this is expensive , the sample speaker . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	This ? 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah , it's four . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Four . It's four Euros . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Oh , them . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	So we are 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah , that's included . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Okay , then we then we need to use it . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Because 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah , no . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	So I just want you 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah , we just made it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	We can do some discussion about this . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Was there room for creativity ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Sure . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yes . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Beautiful . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	I think uh everyone uh already . So 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Or a different style . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	then there we probably have been creative . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	So it's creativity . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Huh . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Okay , so the leadership 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Was there a leadership and 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Of course there was . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	What do you have to say about that ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	No , I think 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Who was the leader ? 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	I dunno . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Just normal discussion , I think . Not 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	one leader or something . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	One leader to check the time , etcetera . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . And make notes . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239	So more like a secretary . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Okay , next one . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Uh team work 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	um The 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah yeah . We were not finished . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	We're not finished . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Uh . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	I think that was the m biggest problem . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Like uh the prices . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah , th that's weird . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	And then 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	We had to 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Hmm hmm yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Yeah , finance . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	But the teamwork was okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	And uh 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	I think uh everyone listen to each other . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	'Kay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	The smart board is okay . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Digital pen is horrible . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	I dunno if you use it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	It was 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Just doesn't work . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	No . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Digital pen or 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Just not work too slow . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah , more accurate . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Precise . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Not just pointing out on it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.292	You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	And so you've 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	But you might as well do it in normal computer style . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah , 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	like . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	And it's far too slow this way . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	No . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	I think 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Digital pen . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	So we made it in time . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217		
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	And we made a remote control . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	We did it . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218		
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	In the budget , yeah . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	New ideas found . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	New ideas . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	What's that ? 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Oh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	For for for 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	I don't know what it mean . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Just 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	I just think if we uh 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247		
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	I dunno . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	For remote control probably . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	No , for the project . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249		
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	For remote control , a favourite for your text . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250		
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Hmm . 	
TS3004d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	No , for the prototype . New ideas . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Yeah . But it's for the next team . 	
TS3004d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . 	
TS3004d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	We don't have to do that . 	
TS3004d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	That's for .
