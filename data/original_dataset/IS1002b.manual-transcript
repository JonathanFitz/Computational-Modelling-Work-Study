IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	So 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	we are here to talk about functional design . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	So here's an agenda . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Uh I'll open . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	as I was struggling to our last time uh 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Um now you can all give your presentations . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	We can talk about the requirements 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	and hopefully come to some decisions . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Right , forty minutes for this meeting , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	so a bit more time than the last one . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Here's the additional points 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Uh did you all receive that email ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Yep . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	So does anyone have any overall 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yep . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	So that's that's that was my reactions . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	So we're quite fixed . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yep . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	we not design the T_V_ . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Hmm . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	That's right . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	I think we take with you . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	So it's kind of a stupid decision . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Right . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	we really have to innovate here I guess . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	K yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	What are we bringing in to take the place of this , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	If we lose one we need to bring two or three . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Okay 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Obviously the the w it has to be branded . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	So then the double R_ will be our our 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	On the product yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	I think one of 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Can you handle that black and yellow ? 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	I tho I tho I thou 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	and we want it to be functional as well , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	You know we don't wanna a big clunker . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Mm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	So you have this ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Nah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	So we have three presentations , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	That's 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Yes . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	That's fine . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Okay so 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	so you all know me , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	I'm the Industrial Designer . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	just basically every remote'll need 'em . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	We need some kinda of power d power source . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	but the in user interface is also a major component . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	You need a on-off switch 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	um I don't know how that got in there . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	and so that'll require some memory as well . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	So those are the basic components that need to go into this 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	I think any des 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	We're talking about existing technology . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	No . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Right 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	I think 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Yeah 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Okay . Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	and the uh th it could als 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Uh I don't have any figures right now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	N okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Mm the shell ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah . Basically yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	That's all I have really . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Okay . Thanks . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	I 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	I can give you that to click on . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Hey mouse . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38		
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Open . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	And you wanna get 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Just go up to view . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Uh . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Click , don't Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Mm 'kay 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	This doesn't work . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	So yeah function design . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	what I found is we want to do fashion 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	and try to aim for design . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	If 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	so we ma we have to make it look good . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Um something cute and small . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71		
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	There's no need to have that in the remote . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So um 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	so simple controls and good ergonomics . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	but um we should go for the 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Because otherwise we're just going to 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	I mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Right as far as 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	So it should be in there . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	i it's just uh the cost of an extra button . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	I mean software-wise there's really no difference . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Okay . Isn't 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	I think . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	I have maybe a silly question . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	I I don't understand how those two things are connected . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	I don't understand that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	So that might play on what we can do . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Yeah 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Scheduling . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and now 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Okay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	and now you can c look it over Internet . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	I think I ha 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Yeah 'cause , yeah , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	I agree . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Well for me 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Well you have digital T_V_ still already . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Unless you have a 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	but you still use it through a teletext . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Okay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	That's the thing . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	But still there there's an opportunity . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Yeah 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Okay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Well I dunno . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	One way the other teletext was there 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	but I guess we can remove it 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	or , you know , make two separate interface designs . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Just you know 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	I just I I 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah , and neither do I in fact . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	but I'm not a tech-mind either . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Bu uh . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	I'll communicate that back to those guys there 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Right it's just not 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	We are selling it to an existing market . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Yeah 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	I dunno I'm 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	That's 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Yeah , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	and and , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	yeah , 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	That's the problem . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	and and we're also marketing a product . It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	I don't I don't see it , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	I need to make it special with a high price tag . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	I want I want to market it as exclusive . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	so the place uh remote the 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Does that make sense , huh ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	No I no I I understand what you say , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	but what I'm what I'm , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	okay we probably need to move along , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yeah we probably should . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	We we're doing alright for time . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	So that's just my question , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	but we can keep talking . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Sorry that kinda cut into you there . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	No 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	that ar 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	They want something that looks nice , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Mm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Is that 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Maybe five percent , you know , 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Yeah mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	and how much 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Yeah okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Be a good idea . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	I'm sorry . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Sorry boss . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	I'm not the boss . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	I think that's probably a question more for 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Is that for over here ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	for this guy here , yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Okay , alright . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Well it's kinda both of us . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Us us user interface . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Is it ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	That's 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	I think of of how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	I was thinking about that . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Then your lights would go off , though . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	uh and and so so um 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	But this 's just something . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	What makes this thing attractive ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	And it's only for televisions . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	So we everyth 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their their televisions 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	and we're coming out with one remote for television only . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	And so to me we have to make this a really special product 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	At this price I don't see it yet . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	I'm I I go along with this , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	because this is what we're given to try to market , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Hmm . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	But we th that should be design . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	That should be the design basically . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Right . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	so we should we should aim at design . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Have to do you have to do it in the box ? 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Okay well , so so that's up to you then 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Maybe make it in the form of a gun . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	We can sell it in United States . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138		
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	I have a question uh for you . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	In terms of making it work or the cost of that or 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	I don't 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	I think all these things are pretty standard . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	I think we'll be okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Cheers . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Onto participant four . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	and uh how do I go here ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Mm you can just click . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Go go . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Is that right ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	No no no 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	you just get off that . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	You just click anywhere . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Ah-ha . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Yeah , what for me is it um 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	That's what we decided here . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	So I say inspiration , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	these were ideas I was putting together , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	so maybe we can have some 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	I I talked about environmentally sensitive , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	I don't know . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	These are just thoughts . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	If if we could have a technological something 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	I have an idea . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Mm p 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	please . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	and it may even fit into ergonomics , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Solar . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	And s for some people 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Well maybe not a solar remote 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	But solar 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	so you'll always know where the remote is 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	And also you can 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Blah , I like it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	I like the idea , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	It w it would increase the cost . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	But boy , we can sell this thing , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	because there's no batteries , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	it's environmentally sensitive , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	And you could page the remote if you lose it . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Maybe there's a button on the cradle . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Yep , that's right . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	I really see 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	But the cost i 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	No no . No no , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	we have t we have to change the end cost . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	There's uh I mean I don't see it anyway . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	that's gonna be up to these guys . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	I my reaction is no , but 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Well 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Yeah 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Well , see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	I I 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Every home's got to have it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	If you don't have one , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178	hey what kind of remote do you have ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Oh you've got one of those , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	oh fantastic , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	I want one of those too . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	I just don't have enough money right now . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	I just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Nah , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183		
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yep , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	They say they say okay here you go . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.192	maybe it is . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.193	I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.194	but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.195	And then let them look at those ideas and 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.196	they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.197	you know we like this idea , this idea no , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.198	but to me it's it's about a choice , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.199	do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.200	beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.201	I don't see it . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	I don I I d 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	I have to disagree though . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	It does what they need . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	These aren't 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	I I think that it 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	And and th to get to back to another point , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	sorry uh uh for cutting in but , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	'cause it's selling on its own . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Right . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Right . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.203	No I understand that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	All you need to do is train them to the individual one , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.204		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Nope , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.206	they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Yeah y y you you wouldn't 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.207	They've identified this product limita 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Oh okay okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	We have done this . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.208	That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	The interface will be different . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.209	If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	I see . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.210	but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.211	And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Well here's 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	And I I'd 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.212	because who wants just a television remote ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Mm sorry . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Right . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.213	I don't . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	We he well here's my thing about that . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	If it can't control if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.215	That's right . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.214		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.216	I I I have a tendency to agree with you . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.217	I really do . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	So we really can't chase that . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.218	That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.219	I really question where we create the demand . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	So I think what we 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	So that's what I'm saying 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	We're really looking for something basic . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	We're selling more than just the product . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	I think that's big . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.220	W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.221	So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Good design . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	We only have a few minutes left . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.222	But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.223		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.225	for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	I think so , yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.226	In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.227	and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Okay . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.228	And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.229	and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.230	So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.231	We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.232	and I don't know what that is . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.233	It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	but we're really doing that to sell the brand . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Yep we have five minutes left . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Or my d 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199		
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	How do you feel about that ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Or how does everybody feel ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Well how does everybody feel ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.235	I mean I I well we g we're talking about the other end now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	I I think 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.236	I like it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.237	I like the idea , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	No , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	but I that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.238	but we have t we have to find out 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	The other the o 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	And I think maybe not 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	because I've got a remote 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Right . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	So it's very good for some people 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	but it's not a like 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Well it lasts 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	it would last for several hours on its own power , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Yeah 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	well it 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	You have to l sort of remember . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.239	Well . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Mm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	But I I don't know , that's just my opinion . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.241	Well , I think again it's it we have a cost issue here . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.242	You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Mm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.245	Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.246	I don't see it yet . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	'Kay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221	So what do we think maybe we should 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.247	W a question I have in in a 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.248	'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.249	The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Really need to wrap up now . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Can can can we have multiple designs ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Have a modern , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.252	have a traditional , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.253	have a you know , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.254	and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.255	I don't know what that creates cost , or 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91		
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.256	Yep one over another . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Yeah , okay , I hear that . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Yeah , complicated but 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Um but what we could do is some kind of 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	well I mean 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I think w what's really important is it has to look good , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	it has to be durable , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.258	What ab what ab 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.259	what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.260	Just an idea . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Just just 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.262	okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.263	They're selling these things everywhere . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.265	it it opens like a telephone . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Or what if it looks like a pen ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Doesn't matter , yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.267	I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	A pointer ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.268	It 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.269	That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.270	I'll sell whatever you guys design . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Mm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.271	I don't have a problem selling a product , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.272	that's not the issue . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.273	I give you ideas , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.274	you guys create the product . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.275	Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.276	Don't worry about it . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.277	I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Okay . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	So 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Um I really 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Okay . Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	A lot of people 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.278	No no . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	As a watch ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Yeah , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	there is remote control watches um , 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	so it might not be easy to market in it 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah they are not simple . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.279	One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234		
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	That's what I was saying . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.280	We gotta stop ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Gotta cut up . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.281	Who's lost or broken their their remote . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.282	So how many remotes do they wanna buy ? 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.283	Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Exactly . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Mm . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.284	And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.285	How does this happen ? 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	The last remote you'll ever buy . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	And also presumably they've 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.286	And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Exactly . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	True . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	because that's just done with mobile phones 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Right . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	The locator'll definitely be more expensive . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Um need to look into whether we can do that 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245	uh checking quickly our Internet . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	We really need to finish up here . But uh 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.287	uh 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.288	we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Yeah we have the the power-adaptor products . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	We sell power-adaptor products . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.289	It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yeah . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.290	So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.252		
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Yeah I think so , 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.291	A charging system . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253	without it being too 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254	In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Right . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.292	If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Right . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Okay . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	Yep . 	
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	You know , something like that . 	
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.257	'Kay . Thanks guys . 	
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yep . 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.293	No that's not what I want , I want 	
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Oh look it here .
