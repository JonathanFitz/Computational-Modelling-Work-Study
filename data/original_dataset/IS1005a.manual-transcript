IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	And uh so I'm present myself . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I'm Fabien Cardinaux 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and uh I I guess you can present yourself . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So I dunno , you can starts . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay , 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	so my name is Petre . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like .

IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Uh my name's Bob Mor . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	And you are ? In the project ? 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Oh , sorry . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Bob , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Bob yeah . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	My name is Hamed Getabdar , 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	so um We are gooding 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	We are talking about the project plan , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	and , yeah . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So it should be , of course , new and original , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	That mean it's a very challenging project , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and uh 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	uh . So w it's 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	we will try to do our best , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So , um 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah and everything is will be like this . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So uh . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh . So uh 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So I will ask you all to do the same . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Just to get used to the whiteboard . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I I th I think I should . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah go ahead . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay , so . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay , American , um . Um . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I would use the bird . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So I tried to sketch it out . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Can you recognise it as a bird ? 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay it's your turn to 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay , okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Oh . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	That's its head . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I dunno if I should go with this . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Oh it's okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Thanks . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	If it is enough line . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Maybe put it up 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I'm sorry . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I should get used to the tool , so . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Oh just wait a little bit . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Ah probably not . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	They should be remote . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay , it it works like this . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh , that's better . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay , thanks . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Your lapel microphone's fallen off . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Are you left-handed ? 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	No . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Oh , pity . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Should I clean ? 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	so if I want to write it here , I think I can . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Oh . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Never mind . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Maybe we should just continue . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah , don't worry about it . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	, no worry . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	No . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	You won't draw them , or ? 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	You can draw it , if you want . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I dunno if I can . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Just try . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I would like to see how it looks like . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I'm not good very good in drawing . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay , so this is very 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It's a bird , I think . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I dunno what is it . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	No , I think it's clear . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Four . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Mm . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . I'm shameful 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Oh that's good , it's good . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	It's okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	It's in it's indeed beautiful . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Good . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , and strong . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah . Okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Bob . Have to remember it . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Bob . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So good um 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So , let's talk about money . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Uh . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	So , um . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	The 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Per unit , I guess . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah , of course . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Y oh okay . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Anything . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um and and normally you only every use , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Oh . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay , I have also some points uh . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Maybe two points . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So something like this . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Ah , okay . Okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	You know , some slider or 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Not just two discrete buttons for volume , 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Okay , n 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	but something which 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	or is that 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Ah , n . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	and it can 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	you have a heart attack . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	but if you have some more notes on that . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh I Yeah , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	so you can 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Do you have something ? 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	just a simple experience . 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah , that's true . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah without obstacles and . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . Let's continue . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Um . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	I have a meeting in five minutes , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	so maybe we should hurry . 	
IS1005a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Okay , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um . So we will close uh this meeting . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	just a second . 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Um . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Uh . The So I will ask you to do some work . 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	start to to have new idea and 	
IS1005a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Which i which is Hamed , ? 	
IS1005a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	read about 	
IS1005a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Mm .
