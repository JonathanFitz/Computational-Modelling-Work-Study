$d@nite:id	$d	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Okay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Oh 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I totally 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Yeah 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	'cause I moved it . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	'S put it over here . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Then we don't have to worry about it . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Ready for this ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	All set ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Cool . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Alright , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	it is PowerPoint time . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	which is kind of fun . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Oh man . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	So uh 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	here we have our detailed design meeting 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	where we will um look at the prototype 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	and 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	um right so um , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	that my coach was sending to me . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Oh 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	really ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	I think . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Huh . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	I don't know . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	s so just to go 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	uh , I will open them slowly , no ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Wait for it , wait for it . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yeah 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	that's not you . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	No . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	That's how the 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Wait . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	double-clicking , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	there we go . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	So um 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	um and what sort of limitations we're operating with 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	um uh excuse me 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	what limitations we're operating under , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	since you could just use your voice . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um , and uh the uh uh 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	So . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	That's sorted , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	back to the main meet here , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	um , go ahead and take it away guys . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Well . Uh , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	we have assembled our prototype , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	What's to be said about it ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Um , we took into account a lot of the things 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	that we went over in the last meeting , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	which you can see 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	This is going to be the on off button 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and we have these buttons to go through the channels 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	um and then two volume buttons down here , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	But this actually can slide back in 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Ah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Nice . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	why not ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Fair enough . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Perfect . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	No 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Go ahead . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	it's important to 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	um f we call it fruity 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Right . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	if you will . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Appropriate , okay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Um . Right , um , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	of course that's uh interchangeable 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	but this is kind of something that can be done 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	It is an option . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	um and as you can see on the television there 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Oh , right . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	That's this here . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Ah . I see . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Um , what other things do we see here , well , um 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	um , so 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	I think that will work well with regards to our market . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um and uh 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	let's see , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um uh 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	do you have anything else to add to that ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Um I worried about the materials , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	it is 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	so it's very durable uh , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Um , and of course as you can see 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Fact , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	I dunno if you noticed , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Oh 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	well done yeah , yeah oh ok 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Nice . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	I thought that was kinda nice . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	This was actually an apple on the inside . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	This 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Oh okay , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	there's preservatives involved , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	polymer 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	we don't need to worry , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	It's fine . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	We got a bit ahead of ourselves , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	okay . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Fair enough . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	No but 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	It's a couple years off at least . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	It's pos a possible new product . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	um I dunno if you guys have any questions 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Brilliant . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Right . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um , did we come in under budget ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Uh we did , yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	This cost 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	well 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	to put this into um production , we're looking at about 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	what was our goal ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	It was twelve fifty Euro 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Um , so I was quite pleased with that . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	One thing that we didn't do 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	um obviously we had a choice with the buttons 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	but we just went for a classic rubber button 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and um since we did that 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	we didn't have to use as many microchips 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	which was quite nice 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	and that's what helped keep the cost down . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Brilliant . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Okay . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	And 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	So uh so uh yeah 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Okay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Hmm . Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Right . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Cool . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Any questions ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	No , no 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I think that's 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	In play now 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um , do you wanna answer this one 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Do we know where we stand on that yet ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	or do you want me to answer it ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	we didn't quite have enough material uh . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Oh 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	I wasn't expecting a prototype 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Oh I see , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	right , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Um , well 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	as you can see this is just a most superficial layer 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Okay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Just veneer really , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	yeah . Okay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Right . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	And the whole thing 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Right 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	So 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I mean there are I 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	There's 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Okay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	which I think worked out fine . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay , very cool . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	It's not it's not quite a a face plate , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	it's more like a pseudo-face plate 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Okay . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	because it's simple enough 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	and we could go the face plate way 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Okay . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	if you know what I mean . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yep . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	It's still an option if we need it . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Very cool , nice job . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Right , yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	thanks guys 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	that's very , very good work . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I like it , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	brilliant . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I got me you've got 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	you provided a number 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	that actually sounds quite nice . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Oh . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Ooh . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	but it looks like 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	So 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	we'll just 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	if we can just itemize what's in here , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	we've got this 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	it's a solar cell thing 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	right ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Right 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	uh we didn't really touch on that 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	With a back-up battery ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	but it it's in there , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	yep . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	With the ba okay . Um 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Clever , clever , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	well done . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	isn't it ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Okay . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	I guess would be that be the general 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	one big curve I guess you could say . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	so maybe we've got two push button interfaces 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	don't we ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yeah , mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	And um a special 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	special . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	don't you ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	'Cause it i it is very unconventional , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	it's it's quite unique . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	I like to think of it as unconventional . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I like it , yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	it's 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	So 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	it looks like 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	M come in at sixteen ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	a bit over budget , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Oh . Huh , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	doesn't match up 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	does it ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	So 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	um or take out the back-up battery . Uh 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	How do you feel about that ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I mean 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	although it does still have a battery 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	when people are calling 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	and saying oh look my remote isn't working 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	what am I gonna do ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Mm k . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	People'd be real upset . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	True . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Nah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	it would have to be 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	seems like we'd have to go back to 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	square one in a way . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	if I've done my math correctly . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	I mean 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	I mean that's what sets us apart 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Which , it's 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	right ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	yeah 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	that's what setting us into this young market , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I mean that's where we started from , so 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	I don't know , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	and I mean you know 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Right . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Right . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Right . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	It's either or . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	I think unfortunately that's our best option . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	isn't it ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Of twelve fifty . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	'cause they're 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	It kind of 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah , . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Savings . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	changing the case wouldn't be so much of a 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	mm-mm , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	um , nor would changing the case materials . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Mm-mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Um . So yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	that looks like to be the only thing . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	So that would be the 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	it's a major change but 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Gotta do what you gotta do . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Alright , so 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	we're in agreement on that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Unfortunately I think we are . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	No , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Right . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Moving along swiftly . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Um , so 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I guess now we just go to the project evaluation 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	which I will allow Sarah to take over . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	That would be me . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Um cord ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Ah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	of course , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	sorry . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	No problem . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Whoosh . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Can you reach , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	that would be great , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yep . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	thank you . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	That'd be great 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	I didn't even do that one on purpose either , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	damn . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Okay , um , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	these are the things we needed to do , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	these are the things that look like we feel they're important . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Um so I was looking at basic design things , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Is the design what we wanted it to do ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	are technologies up to where we hoped they would be 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Does it respond to voice recognition ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	because it's a new sort of interface , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	um that looked like it was coming up rough , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Really good . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	So . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	They like that spongy feel . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	It looks like it's going over well , so 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	And the paging function works well , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Six ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	that's good to hear , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	we're we're good yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	we worked hard on that one . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	We did . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Brilliant . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	It's 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	so 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	it's all good . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	That's everything from me . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	but it's okay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	it is a set-back , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	but 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Okay , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	do you need the cord back ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Um yeah , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	I was just 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	go on . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	that we're 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	I know . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Well 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	they don't own tellys anyway 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	do they ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I guess that's true . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	True . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Right . So , um , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	I got this slide from the coach 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	and I'm not sure what it's connected to . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	and that is gonna go into my report . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	So 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	and how that all worked , I guess , um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Okay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	As in within the team or ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I think so yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Right so 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Okay . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	I think it's I 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	mm-hmm , I think so . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	'Kay . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	It is now , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	you're in charge 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	so 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	there you go . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	But I trust that she would jump in if I was 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	so okay 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	fair enough . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Whatever . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Um right , um so 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	any thoughts ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Are we considering these points here ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Okay . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	I think they're starting blocks 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	What do you guys feel about the process ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Um , you know 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	considering the little amount of input we had going in . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	We didn't use the whiteboard at all . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	No , we didn't . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	No . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	No , no whiteboard . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	We could now if that'd make up for it 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	And 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	but really 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	I didn't write barely anything . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	I think I was taking notes more often than usual 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah , it's true . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Uh . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Was pretty cool tack though . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Definitely . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	As you write your personal coach . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	but I didn't get a response 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	What if you get a response two or three months from now ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	so 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	we'll see . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Okay 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	That'd be weird . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	that would be kinda creepy . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Attempts to contact coach ineffective . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	what kind of coaching is that really ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	What if I really needed something . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I so 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	I don't 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I think so . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	And even then we did get a decent product turned out 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	although it's not everything we wanted it to be . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	With the natural look . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	That's very natural . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Very natural look . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Organic , really . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	And highly resourceful team mates might I add 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	which is always a plus . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	I think the teamwork was good as well . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Mm yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I'm impressed . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	we used every bit . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Nice . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	All four of those little containers . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	I guess 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	we only had four , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	wasn't enough . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	I know 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	it could have been amazing . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Oh well . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	What did you guys think about the the the roles ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	They were good . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	it's f kind of fun , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	it was 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	I think it was pretty clever 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	'cause we were never able to get too far off track 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	because the information came in at the right time 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	and kind of filled in the gaps enough . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	True . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Do your own . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	which was kind of fun . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	I mean maybe it's just me 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	That's true , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Nothing , I didn't even get an email , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I I got this spreadsheet . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	like 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	that was it . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	So , yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	I feel like that was slightly lacking 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Well 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Whatever . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Of what to do . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	no 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	but also 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	yeah 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Uh-huh , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	that wasn't very much . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	You know 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	because that was kind of the interface portion 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	which was what the whole project was about 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yes . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Mm , mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	uh 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Hmm , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	very much so . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	but 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	That was fun . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	which was fine . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Very much so . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Cool . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	And I think your leadership was quite good . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	It was really good yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	She said I I I 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	she actually made a comment off 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	boy you're getting into this 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	and I really I think it's true 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	That's kind of a good thing though , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	I felt like I slipped into it a lot . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	It's kinda fun . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	you know , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	I dunno . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	An 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	so 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I usually organise crap , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	you know ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Little different . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	I 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	other than that 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	I could only imagine . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Possibly . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	like make a remote control or spaceship , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	we used to have spaceship Legos 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Oh yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . Totally . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	still have 'em . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	everybody knows best spaceships ever . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I think so . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yep . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	You don't . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	I don't I I was just I 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Though we didn't actually 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	It's true huh ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	well 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	I mean 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	That's true . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	It d 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah that is kind of 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	But yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Interesting . It's kind of fascinating 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	wasn't it ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	I mean the whole process of 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Wonder why 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	I don't know . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	I I don't know if there was a ri I th 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Mine was the mics . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah , that's it 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	'cause the mics are loose 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	True , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	but it didn't even occur to me as an option , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	I mean I don't know that I would have 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Nor I . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	but I know that I consciously didn't . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	I mean 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	True . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I just used it 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	'cause it's literally right in front of me . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Well 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	it looks really professional . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	I know . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	because my handwriting is crap . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	I mean , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	that's it . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Usually I would do a lot more doodling too 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	but I didn't 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	because 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	I know , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	I felt like I needed to be professional 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Okay , well 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	not entirely , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	but still , I doodled less than I usually do . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	T 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	You know , like 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	what is the uh 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	what exactly we're looking for here . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	So 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	is this all we need to get through ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	I dunno , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I guess . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Um . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	New ideas . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Is it 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Well , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	but this slide was just there , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	That slide was like that ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	I didn't change this one at all . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Well . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Um ch 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	I guess we're on the right track . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Yeah well . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	W I kinda like th 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	No , none . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Uh I think they still do their job . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	I think they're fine actually . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	you can't 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	I don't 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Does kinda make you wonder , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	I mean , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	how much can you do with a remote control ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	It's like inventing a new car . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Yeah yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	It's still gotta be technically car shaped 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	you can 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	or it won't fit on the road , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	you know ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Don't know . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Um . 'Kay . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Kind of . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	So this was other costs . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Are we back into project mood ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	I dunno . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	I think this is 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Oh , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	how long was our meeting supposed to be ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	How much time do we have left ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	forty ish 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Like , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	what like you know what am I really doing , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	you know 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	what is 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	at the beginning it started out 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	and I felt actually like under pressure 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	like the first couple were taking a lot of work 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Yep . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	that you guys don't really care about anyway 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Why ? 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	so type away . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Hey . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Huh 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	You know , you know what I mean 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I think it was the real . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Whatever . Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	Very much , yeah . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	I actually didn't do that at all though , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	or edited 'em . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	I di 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Oh 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	I added like five slides too , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	See 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Oh . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	I only got blank ones . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Did you really ? 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	but I 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	I just got blank ones 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	and 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	What ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Really ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	My slides were all blank , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	they'd have a title maybe 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah , mine too . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	and they were just empty . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Me too . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Did they not have they didn't like uh mine 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	they didn't come like this ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Like with 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	this was what it looks like . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Like with those words already on it ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	This is what that looked like , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	literally , just like that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	No . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	No . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Interesting . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Uh-huh huh huh . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	I deleted slides . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	I think I added a slide one time . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I added many slides every time 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Hey 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	That was pretty cool , 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	it was a high moment of the whole experiment . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Um . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Interesting . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Any other thoughts come to mind ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	I wanna know how our product would fare . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	I can't just leave it there . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	I think it would fail , I think 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	I think it would take extensive marketing , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	okay , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	But you know the whole 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Even you . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	I don't 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	Yeah but 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	I know it is . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	It's a happy face . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	Builds . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	I I noticed that . By accident . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329		
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247		
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	that happened to be consumed . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	Interesting . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Well huh . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	An interesting day all in all I would say . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Yeah , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Uh , yeah , I'd say so . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	it's uh 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	So 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	again I reiterate my question 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	I know . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	Mm , I know . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	I wanna see a 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	I 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Well 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	the id 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	okay 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	'Cause it's such a functional item . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	the notion of 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	yeah I mean 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	it's just it is what it is . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	You know , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	proposed idea . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Mm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	I dunno . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	But . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	All in all it's kinda interesting . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	So 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	we have more slides or ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323		
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	No 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	just this closing one . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	No 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	but we could s you know do it 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	We got it to be . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	Like cutting corners . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Kind of , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	and 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	Mm . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Which I'm not sure is the same thing , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	True . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	at the time that just i made more sense , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	but I could see if they were really asking about us . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	And it's all recorded , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	woo-hoo . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	Yeah 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Yay . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Hmm . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	I 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	Make it sound eloquent . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Oh , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	I have to done I've 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	I've done transcription before 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	Nice . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	Oh yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	that mean nothing . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	What the uhs and the 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Really . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Filler words or ? 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	Yep , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	they're called um disfluencies . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Disfluencies . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	That's a good word for it . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	Yeah 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262		
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	Just add some prefixes , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	sounds classier . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	Exactly 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	uh I will save this into the project documents . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	I , 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Mm .

ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	It is scary . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Mm . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Well 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	just around that eight or or nine people that are 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	I know , 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	Yeah .

ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .

ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	But it's not regular 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	and I got it in ninety four , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	but still . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	It's crazy . So 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	Uh-huh . 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	In the eighties ? 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	My um grammy does computer science back in the States 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	Mm . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	There's basically the fundamental structures , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	but it wasn't uh household to household yet 	
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Right . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	because it hadn't been

ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	'Kay 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	I think that's a closer . 	
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	Cool . 	
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Has it been forty minutes or whatever ?

ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	Okay , 	
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	that's the end of the meeting .
