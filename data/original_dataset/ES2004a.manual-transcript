ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Seventeen Pounds . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Seventeen . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Okay , that's expensive . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Should we be making notes of this ? 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	We can just refer to this later can't we ? 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	But 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	I think so , I think so , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	I'll be able to um pull it up , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	or I could put it in the shared folder or something . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Okay . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	So , it'd still be 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Right . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Really ? 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	yeah , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	we had to buy one . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	So 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	I think 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	we d or 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	um production cost's at twelve fifty , so 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Okay , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	pretty huge margin . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	half of the selling price is taken up by building it . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	which is uh 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	In our first year ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yi yes , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	um yeah , I presume so . Um 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	So then 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	You've got market range international 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	No , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	user-friendly to everyone . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Okay . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Big target group . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	yes , yes , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	I don't think we have to 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	No . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	um making that a key point , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Mm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Okay . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	What are your experiences with remote controls ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	I mean I've got we got um we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Alright . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Yeah , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	that c 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	but that kept losing the signals 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	I think it was quite a cheapie as well , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	so that might have had something to do with it , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	uh . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	but that was quite good , the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Use all the ones at the same time . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Right . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Okay , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	you wanna integrate everything into one like 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Okay . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	'cause you 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	not doing any tampering with it and programming , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	I don't think I could go any further with it than that , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Yeah , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	and you don't want to 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Mm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Um . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So simplification of symbols you could think of . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	When they're 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	when you've got the main things on the front of it 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Oh yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Mm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	it's obvious what you're doing , um . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Actually that just raises a point , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	I wonder what our design people think , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Menu , alright . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Uh uh 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Right , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	I was thinking on the same lines you , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	like a mobile , yeah and with menus . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	With menus , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	What about the older generation ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	What about granny and grandads ? 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	You mean to save it lesser number . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Right . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	I don't think they tape things , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	I don't think they use 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Right . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Right . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Mm , yeah , the age gap . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Mm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	I don't know , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	But I don't know how 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	I d 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Oh yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	I find it really confusing , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	I kept getting lost in the phone , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	I di I've not got a new one 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	but uh my friend got a new one 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Right . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	but that's just me . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123		
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Okay . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Obviously it displays less on the screen , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Teletext has got that option as well . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	it displays less on the screen 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Or what about kind of a dual function ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Mm , okay . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	I think that's a cost thing , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	S 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Y 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	It might 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yeah ? 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	it might save a b bit of space , 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Yes , no that's important . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Yeah , like smaller . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	But it might have its cost implications . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Okay . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Mm . 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Right . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Something that's easily moulded and produced . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	No uh uh 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Um , right , okay

ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	I think that's probably about it 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	and then we'll come back and liaise again 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah .

ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Sure . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	The sort of 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	I I had a quick look at the company website 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Ah right . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	so I think think the whole design thing might be qui 	
ES2004a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Okay . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Okay . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Okay .

ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	I mean you don't you you can still have plastic 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	y yeah . 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	and it'd look quite good but 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	But yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	th that was my main point , 	
ES2004a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Yeah . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	we don't have to use metal , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Mm . 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	I presume it would .

ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	They're kind of moulded 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	and look a bit different , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	which looks a bit smarter , 	
ES2004a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Right . 	
ES2004a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
