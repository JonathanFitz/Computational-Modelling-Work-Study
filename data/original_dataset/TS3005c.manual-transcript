TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Okay , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	welcome everyone to our next meeting . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I'm busy writing 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	and busy leading the meeting , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	which was quite some typing . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay , well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	I'd say let's start with the first presentation . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	'Kay . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um in the same order as last time ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	W 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	sure . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Mm . Alright . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Okay . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Well , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	take it away . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	uh welcome you all . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Components design , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	I I elaborated on the concept . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	What should be um 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	uh said about uh the components , uh its properties 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Don't destroy my giraffe . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Giraffe's gone now . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Okay um 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	There's one of the 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Drop it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	and they break uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	becau 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	the uh titanium was also an option . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	But uh it's a very expensive material . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	for our remote control . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Uh titanium uh you have to paint it 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	and with that uh it's possible to scratch it 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	or uh yeah make it ugly . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	But it's a very strong material . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Uh so 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	it's t two dimensional . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I think it's uh it's best to draw 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	oh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	green . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	It's a colour . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	New . Blank . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Okay . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	You have to go t 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Let's make it uh black . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Okay . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I thought of an idea like this . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Oh that . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Um delete . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Blank . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	So it also looks nice when it's on your table . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	So you get 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but it's c it's stands . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Oh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	it's a side view . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Side view yes it's side view 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	so uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	but . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Um uh it's just an idea I had 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	so it's uh it's very uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	so its also looks nice when it's on the table . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	which is uh is easy to clean too . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	And um it should be made of strong plastic 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and it should be bright . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	and I think 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	uh well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	we also we almost concluded about that 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	True . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	uh that's all about uh the buttons . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Questions , ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	No no no no no . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	No . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Just looking . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	And next step is the chip 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	so uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	there should be some more uh investigation on that side . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Uh my personal preferences uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	That was correct , wasn't it ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Okay . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Well , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	so yeah , it needs colour , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Okay 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	they should be m sh they should be in mind , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	wasn't it ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	It must be recognisable . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Okay okay . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	that's possible of course . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	You can put the R_ and R_ . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Uh so 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	they are pretty boring , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	which peopl uh who people 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	in 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	which people will find they're uh interesting . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	imp instead of uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	because it yeah it makes sense . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Okay . Well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	that's all about my uh my findings . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Alright . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Okay , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	thank you . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Mm mm mm . Next . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	I will go next . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Alright so 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	so I had to uh look on that . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	and it answers you . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	uh you say record into the device into the speaker 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	and then you say the question 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and three seconds later you say the answer 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Mm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Um perhaps it's useful , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Mm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	perhaps for because people um lose the remote , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Mm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	It's true . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	And perhaps we could uh implement that . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	And then I have to go out of the presentation 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Oh my God . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	but I can't draw , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	so uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	don't make too much of it . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I don't know if there is an icon for the program , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	but 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Not just a P_ . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	P_ 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	yeah , just a P_ . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	.. . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	and then the buttons above and uh below 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Um . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Where's where's the button for two ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	I forgot that one . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Okay . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	I thought I forgot something , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	but uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	And uh and uh the numbers , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	that should be a bit larger 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Ah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Doesn't matter . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Um an options button . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	because it's not really options , I think . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	No . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Yep . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	So could call it settings or something . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	But this is a bit uh how I thought it . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	so that it's better in your hand or something uh . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Oh okay , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and that you could do with something like this this . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Oh yeah , . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	So they want to u use one button and then something happens , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	and not choose with uh this kind of uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Okay . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	That's an option . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	And that was my uh finding 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	dinge . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Thanks . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Okay . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Now our third 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Go Danny , go Danny . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	team member with his presentation . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Okay , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	'Kay . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	The method I used was 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Findings I made . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	okay , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	so that should be great meeting for this . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	And the third thing is it should be easy to use . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Fruity ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Grass green . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Fruity . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Yeah . Like that . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Mm . Okay . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Let's build it into a sponge . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Th 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	They liked square shapes with round edges . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And hard materials like wood , um titanium . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	They 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	those kind of materials they liked . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Oh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	y 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	this or something . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	It's it's a bit like a banana . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	And the colour should be yellow , or something . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	And for the elderly people just plain old . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	or was it two colours ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	It was one remote , I think , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Different colours , yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	different colours . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Simple but 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	easy to use . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Mm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	So that's it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Okay . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	So for the older people , a more traditional uh form . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	That is my 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	like the older o older colours I can maybe 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	I don't know which shape you should should take , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Colours th the elderly people 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	but . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	the shape of it . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Perhaps you could find something in the middle . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Round but square . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	s 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	round corners , but s but square , yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	But maybe then both groups won't buy it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	i 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Do you know what I mean ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah I know what you mean , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	kind of like a . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	wait , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	like like this uh a bit . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Kinda like a beer glass . Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	So 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	but then 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I know what you mean . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Same sides . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	But that's uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	but that's also how other remotes are shaped , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	so that's uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	But perhaps that's a good thing , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	so that's easy to use . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	People know the 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Will recognise that's as a remote control . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Uh Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Uh when I saw your d 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Oh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	They liked the wood a lot . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Huh . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	kinda like old cars , uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Let's put it all together . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Swords . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Those kind of 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah , those kind of things . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	So you see the big difference 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	And the old people , old and boring . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	So 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Sorry ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	That's easy to do with the colours , I think . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Uh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah we think so too . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	In material yeah rubber , rubber is , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	and the old people like plain wood . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So we have to decide if we're going to use 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	think uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Soft rubber . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Also in between . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah soft rubber 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	which you can you can feel in it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah I know what you Um . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	I don't think you should be able to mould it , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Or 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	but 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	No . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Or or wh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	It should shouldn't be . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	what's something harder . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	No no no 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	but but you have to 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	or something harder . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Bit like this kind of rubber . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	This uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah , something like this , yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	But it's quite hard , this . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah it's quite hard 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	but you can press it in . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	It's feels kind s spongy . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Spongy . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Something . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	I don't think it's rubber . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	No . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	N n n 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	So we need a spongy feeling . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Uh did you have something about uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	So we should first decide about shape , I think . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Ding ding . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Which uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	and can decide uh . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	.. . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	This was your size , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	but I think it should be larger . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	three quarter of the of the 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah , three quarters . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	So uh so you don't have to put your oh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Uh new , blank . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	So uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	when you get this uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Ooh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Uh kinda like this . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Or should it be larger ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Larger I think . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Larger ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Because you want to put your hands 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	But if you pu 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	becau because you have 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	You want 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Perhaps that's best . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah okay , true , true , true true . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Your thumb here . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	But not on the screen because 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	that's uh that's an idea . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Because when you put your f 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	You 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	You always touch it , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Going to be very greasy and stuff . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	But it won't get that small 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	One to zero , the two digit , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah you don't want it too small . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	How yeah how large 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	You have to you have to 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Yeah they have thick fingers . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	But if you wanna make it in international , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah true , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	but 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	and we got these large 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	we have we have the zoom option , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	right ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	No . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	hey , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	we we want to do it with our fingers , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	right ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Your fingers , yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	You don't want uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Y you could include a pen 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Use a pen You you c 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	you can lose the pen . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Yeah 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah the fingers , yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	because th they're used to that 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	and 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I don't know how how large the actual remote should be 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	but a little bit like this , or something . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	but that that can be with plain soft tissue . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	You can do whatever uh any uh cloth . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	you can buy those at 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Okay well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	maybe , if I can interrupt you , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Sure . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	So we can discuss these points . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	those points um energy question mark . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	How how should we uh supply the thing with energy 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and how 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	are we going to do it with separate docking station 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	and then put in it . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Uh chip on print and case . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	but I hope you have ideas about them . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	I think energy were batteries 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	and then uh and uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	The docking station . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	So that's the the the first point . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	We already decided that on the previous meeting . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	W 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	which you can recharge through the docking station . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	So 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	if the badg the batteries are dead 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Just like with the telephone . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I kinda like your 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	then you can re you can uh change them . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah yeah yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	like those . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Kinda like those kind of batteries . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yep . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	but it should be th I think normal batteries , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	not not like two or two uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah , normal plain 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	you 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	No 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Simple rechargeable uh batteries . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Um what was with the chip on print ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	The chip on print ? Um 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Uh you gotta f 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	I think so . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Print plate . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	We also discussed that . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Didn't we ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Yeah 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	You still have a print plate . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	You always have a print plate . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Beg your pardon ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	You always have a print plate , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	right ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah sure , of course , yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Always , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	so 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	it's a good question . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168		
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	It just was in there 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Well uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and I didn't have any information about it , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	but 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	But 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yeah okay , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	and you got on the and on the 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	so that that's not of any discussion , I think . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	I suppose so . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	It is a simple C_P_U_ 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	but it doesn't 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah yeah okay 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	because it has to uh b 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah , okay , true true . True . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	to know uh in which state you are 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	It's rubber . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	we wanted to make it from rubber 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	and uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	but but a hard rubber like this ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Or softer rubber 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	or 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Uh hard rubber I think . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	That's the easy to ha uh to to uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yeah sure , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	We have different colours . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	look . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	this in different colours ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	So 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	D 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	No I don't think , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	I think it's more round than square . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah it's a bit . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	So it meets 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	I think it meets more the young people than the older people . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . I think so too . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	But that's what we want , . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah , that's our target . Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	It's our main target . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Lower than forty years , I think 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	it was . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Oh yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	that that I think 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	So i 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	I thought that was a quite good 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Because it's a gadget 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	and you want to show it off , of course . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah yeah 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	you have a fancy design , then , right away . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Uh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	So 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Because it 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	you don't have to put it get it in your hand , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	you can put it next to you 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	and then dive it in 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah , that's a good idea . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	and . Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	It's a lot easier . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	alright . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	So 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	So , so 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Okay so 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	you got uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Did you write that down ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	And then 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Uh got a single curved uh rubber 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	f uh fancy coloured remote control . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	You can't you You can't 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	oh , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	you c you can draw it on your paper 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	and then load it on the 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah , you can uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	It's pretty easy 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	but I wrote it down . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	but 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	And load it on the the user the server . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	And 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	What about the user interface , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	you have some ideas on that . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	I had what I just uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	You you showed your drawing . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	I should again . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	I miss a few buttons , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	but . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Well . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	At least uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	you have to go back . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah uh uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	This 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	I don't know . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	With the minus and the plus . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	I think it's 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	I think it's easier than 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I don't know . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	but I don't know what they think . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Sorry ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	For sound and channel . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Depends on the screen . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Th 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	If you make it uh in a rectangle 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Right well 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	if we make it like this , I think if you 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	I so it's it's it's it's 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	put it like this 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Square . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Oh , okay . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	And on here . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	The other buttons and on here the top . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	But I think I wou 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	and the sound . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	I think that's a matter of what you're used to . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Something uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	And then the P_ in the mid in the middle 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	and the sound uh in the middle . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Uh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Something like 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Sh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Take your time . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Plus minus plus uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Almost . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	minus . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	but I think 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	I don't know . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Perhaps I have some examples . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	W 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	I don't know 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Who's the usability engineering ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	That's me . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	She is . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Oh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	The 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Um 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	'Cause they can use that better . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Consistency . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Oh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I have that those s numbers . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	I Here is our here are uh 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Or a good watch . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	I don't really know . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	B 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Everybody's searching in his data . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Volume selection four times an hour 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	So not how much n not how often it's used , but 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	W what's what's usual or normal . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	that depends on on on the remote . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Yes 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	I'm looking here . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	But here's it's below , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	here also , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	and now here's here's next to each other . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I think it's it's a 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	I think 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	because I have two televisions at home . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	One is horizontal , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	one is vertical , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	so it depends . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	it does it doesn't really matter , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	but 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . Depends . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	because you go higher and down . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Yeah , lower . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	And the the pay the the 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	the program is next to each other , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	because you would go further and back . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	True . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	That's how it's is usually when I look here 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Okay , um . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	that's what I see . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Let's cut to the chase . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	It's got to change . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265		
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I think we have we don't have to decide about that now 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	how 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	where we will put the buttons 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	I don't know . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Yeah is it is user interface . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	just the 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	concepts . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Component . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	This concept is in the actual design , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	but you should know where you would place a 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Okay , well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	le 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Yeah . Interface , yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	And the speech uh shall we implement that ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Or uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I think it's it's easy for that , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Technologies , uh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	where are you , but then it says I'm here . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	Makes it possible to 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	But then you should also find a place 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Mm . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	You can talk into the corner . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Yeah , a microphone , yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Not even necessary , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	because a lotta 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	you can make a very sensitive microphone , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	But 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Yeah , that's also . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	Right . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	over there . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	So , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	But that's not import I think that's not im very important 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	in the middle or something . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	but you should uh decide where you want to put it . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	Ah okay , sure , okay , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Right ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	well 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	tha 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Um I think where it isn't seen 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Underneath ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	the most . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Inside . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	Yeah sure , why no 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	I i 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	between the round of the R_ . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	So 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	where do you want to put it ? 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	maybe where the one hand 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	actually it does 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	because it you can you can find it better if you use it . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	bu but 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	It's a way for you to uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Uh . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	So it makes more sense 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	just 'cause other remotes don't have that . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	About a microphone , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	there is no button . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	because a microphone is very small thing , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	but you can make it look like it's big 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	so as its its really an important function of the remote . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	I think the left s under corner should be the best . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Where isn't i it isn't most in sight . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	I think . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299		
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	That doesn't doesn't really matter . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	No . Actually doesn't . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	Okay . So ? 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Alright . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Any more uh 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	So well uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	Interface type . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	type , supplements , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	anything . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah , well 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	The L_C_D_ yeah , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	uh supplements well the supplement is to 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	and 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304		
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	If you want to go back you have to back button go back , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348		
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Hey , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Um yeah . Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	. 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	the the young people do like uh scroll uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	Use the scroll . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah ? You do like it ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	Yeah I think so too . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	So why not , on on side . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Or at least 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Yeah 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	I don't know if it's really the scroll , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	but the menu they like most , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	Fast , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	yeah . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Yeah I think it is is faster . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	So 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	if you've got a settings , if you 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Becau 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	Yes . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	but if you don't have a lot of option then 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	But you have it's f uh 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	You have a lot of options , 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	we have five or four or something . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	because when you use 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	Yeah 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Y 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Uh-huh . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Yeah , okay , true . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Yeah . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Okay . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Okay , no problem . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	which you can touch 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	Yeah .

TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Is there a standard colour ? 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	we don't

TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	You should you should have a black one 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	but you should have a standard colour . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	because uh I think black is standard . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard . 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	Black ? 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	With the with the yellow uh

TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	Silver , yeah . 	
TS3005c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Silver .

TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	so uh

TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	w what about a yellow thing ,

TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	it'll be a banana yellow , we have . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	could be ugly , 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	but it's definitely fancy . 	
TS3005c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	R red .

TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	When you use titanium , silver is fancy , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy .

TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	Silver has to shine , 	
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	and rubber doesn't shine . 	
TS3005c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Mm-hmm .
