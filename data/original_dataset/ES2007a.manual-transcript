ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	And they're healing as well . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	They heal . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And they can feel when a human's got problems so 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Wow , so they're kinda spiritual .

ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	no 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	uh 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Oh a squirrel ? 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	That's exactly what it is . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Uh not a very good one 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72

ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Right . Okay , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm . Let's move on to the next page . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay , project finance , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	selling price twenty five Euros , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	profit aim fifty million Euros .

ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	ah right 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Ah right okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	experience with with remote control , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Stuff like that . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	At quarter to twelve . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So I think before we close uh , we are expected 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	S 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	oh okay . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Pretty much everybody . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah , I think we've all got 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Uh . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Um . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	'Kay um . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Well . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	T 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	A new remote control for T_V_ . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	What would I like ? Um . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	W what 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	You want it big do you want it small . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Medium . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Maybe you 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	yeah 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	But how do we know how much uh , 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I mean , how much do we have per how much ? 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Twelve fifty . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Twelve fifty . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Each . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Per unit , yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Cost . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So do we have to be realistic within the budget or 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Guess 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Right . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Like so you have one in like mm 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	it doesn't have to be really thick . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I mean remote controls can be thin bits . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	and then you have another one , you slide it out . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	'Kay . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	have slides . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And then it all comes compact 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Okay , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	that's . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	into one . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So it's not 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Th that's an idea . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So you just flip them out . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	One side for kids , one side for adults . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I'm not sure if that's like 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Oh . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Oh okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Like it 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	That would be cool . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I was thinking that like a flip . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Um , oh we've got five minutes left . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Start breaking up . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . Um . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	But okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	. 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	we should uh 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	you know stage one was technical functions design , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	what effect the apparatus should have . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	D_V_D_ players , things like that . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I have got 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Right . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	What do you reckon ? 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	I mean . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , that's true , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and have it be um 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	uh simple to use , and looks decent and 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	May w you know , maybe even 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I mean if it's if it's just like 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	or so people that uh b don't see very well 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	or big buttons for touchy buttons for 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	certain certain demographic 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Or just one that looks really fucking cool . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , no I think you're right . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	rathe rather than focus on 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Y 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah , 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	I mean obviously everyone 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah , that's right . Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I think a flip up thing , 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	well I did anyway , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	So maybe something that like 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	does have a lid or closes , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	yeah . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	So make it 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah , that's true what you were saying , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98		
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Okay . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	And even for kids as well . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	It's um it's safer for them , I guess . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	No porn channel for children . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Okay . Um alright , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	so we've got some ideas , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	we've got um 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I guess that's good good for now . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Let's move on . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Oops , let's close that . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Next meeting , uh okay . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Industrial Designer 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Ah ri okay . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	um which is 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	these are requirement specification . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	That's 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Um . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	And I'm marketing .

ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	User Interface Designer , that's that's 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	That's me . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Okay .

ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Right . Right . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm . Har how it works an 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	And in marketing 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	These are requirement specification . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Bu 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	User requirements specifications . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So what the user requires 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah , 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Do you think our two kind of overlap , because 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	in a remote . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	what 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Right , okay , yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I guess that's what it says . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . 	
ES2007a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . 	
ES2007a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm . 	
ES2007a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now .
