ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Right . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Alright . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Is everyone here ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yep . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yep . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	This is our conceptual design meeting . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	And 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um then each of you will have your presentation , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um and 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	People thought their remotes were ugly , um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	that remotes zap a lot . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um and that they often lose the 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	it's easy to lose a remote . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	And uh some sort of locator . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Either a button or tracking device . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	And that it should look different than what's out there . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um the simple versus the um the complex . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Have it s be something that looks different . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	How that would power the remote and the lamp . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	If we were to to have one . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	And with a , just a few buttons . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Just the basics . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And with a scrolling um function also . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and I will leave that , leave it at that . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Marketing ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	We're watching trends . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yep . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Can I have your cable please ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I suppose that you can have this . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Thanks . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	which I think we've kind of already discussed before . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	but we can try . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	I don't know , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	A banana shape ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Oh it was sort of banana shaped . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . Yeah . Right . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Or with exterior designs . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And then the spongy feel . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So that's that . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So possibly like a uh , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Alright . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	sorry , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	just to butt in for a second . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	That's what I was thinking yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So when you buy your remote you can buy 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	feel to it . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	You can 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	various coverings . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Mm various covers . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	What's it called ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Cust you 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Personalise your remote . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	personalised , yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	We could leave that to the cover department . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	We all know they've got nothing to do all day . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Why can't I see the 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	crazy . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um okay . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	I have a 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	there is a picture . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So the technology is there . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	You can sort of just make those out . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And then on the right is obviously an iPod , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	and really is , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	That is a possibility . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And nothing's simpler really . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um I don't 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	And that is it . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Why am I 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Oh yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Just . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Where are we ? Uh . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Just to sort of show you . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	M they've even got things like that . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Huge things . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Notice the giant dog bone shape ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Dunno . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	And that yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Makes sense , makes sense . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Also good for animals . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	See . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	things . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	. 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Why's my screen crazy ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Uh 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Well let's see . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I've more information on possible materials um as well . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	What we can and cannot do . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um but let's just wait for this to load up 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	and I'll show you what we're talking about here . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Okay . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Right . Pretty clear . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	This is the circuit board from the other side . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um the lower part of it , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I don't know if you can see that properly , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Um you can see the circuit board itself . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	These are the actual keys that are being pressed . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	They close the electric circuit . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	That would be behind here . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And thus gives on the signal . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Now this is the simple version . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	And not only that . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	rubber , as well . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So it's pretty squishy . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Spongy ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	That would that would serve that purpose . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Um we could also use wood , or titanium . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Oh fya 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	I don't have an information on that . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	It certainly is an expensive material , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I'm aware of that , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	but I was given an okay . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Now let's first go through the list with the materials . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Can also mix these . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Right ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Uh a dynamo . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Interestingly enough . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um we could use solar cells . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	right ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um solar cell is interesting . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	May fail though , every here and there . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Would you have to leave it by the window ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm . Yeah 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	. Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and yeah mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Always the you 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	But 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Y probably not yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	exactly . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	We don't need that then . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	However 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	our interface options are push-buttons . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	And they are possible . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	We have an okay for scroll wheels . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Okay . Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	This however may exclude certain um materials . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Hence we might not be able to put it in there . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	but that's not up to me to decide really . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	So that's for the for the scroll wheel . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um it limits our choice 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Let's see now . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	right ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Or is anybody still 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	alright . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	No . Hmm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Alright . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	We would just be able to make it flat and 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	and um yeah 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	a straight design pretty much . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Like a covering . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	But then where do people hold it ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Just all be sort of spongy . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	So you 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Like the iPod ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	You can have an L_C_D_ screen . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um but therefore no rubber will be used . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Right . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Alright ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Um latex 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	is tricky . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Or rubber 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Or wood even . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Or make it just push-buttons . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Maybe not the nicest feel . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Or not much originality really . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Or the rubbery we cannot ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	'Kay . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Mm . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	That's the tricky thing . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So that's thing if we did it yellow . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	They wouldn't have any 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	they're just on the exterior . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	S Certainly can be done yes . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Um yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	I assume . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	So 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	The fruit design um 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	but uh give it like the surface of 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	an orange , banana , whatever . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	You name it . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Mm . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	What about a smell ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Just design-wise . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	T to the remote ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Mm . Nice one . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	In different ye yellows . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Bright citrus colours yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Mm . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	I don't suppose we have to stick to co 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Stick to the colours yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Oh yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yellow and grey . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	that's yellow and grey . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yellow and grey . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	So what have we , 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	lemon , banana , is 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Mm grapefruit . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Grapefruit . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Grapefruit 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	But mm . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	. 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Um 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	like 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Well we kinda do yeah . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	So 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	And if it's yellow ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Right . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It's it's yellow . It's curved . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	I it's yellow . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Grey buttons yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	It's sort of 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	couple of couple of grey stripes . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	On the the gr 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	the rubbery grips could be grey . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	There you go . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Rather than rather th 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	It could 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Oh . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	and then people would always know where it was . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Nice . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Could look like a fruit bowl . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	It could be an ape . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Could be , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	we could have a variety of options here . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	'Kay . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Do you have more to your presentation ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	That's pretty much it . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Oh . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	there you go . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I'm gonna plug in here real quick . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Sure . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	If I could . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Hang on . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	There you go . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	ow . Ow . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	So is the two piece idea out ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Or have we not decided ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	And the base station might not be necessary . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Oh right okay . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	We can still do that . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	design which we saw there . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	But could be done , of course . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Probably case um material . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	And probably a shape also . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	And what kind of supplements we'll have . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Right . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And we have five minutes . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Mm . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	a cheap one . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Right ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	'Kay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Um I guess we should pick the case then . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Well what about what you said , like putting the 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Just 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	. 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	just maybe 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	finger grips just on top of the plastic ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	yeah . Just a little bit of . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	So we would , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	'Kay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	So I guess the case would be plastic , 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	. 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	M more of a l lamination perhaps . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah I think so . 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah ? 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	I think 	
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yes . It does . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	'Kay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	I guess that , is that , is that about it ? 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Right . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Here's what's gonna be going on . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Right . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141		
ES2016c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	maybe and and get us a prototype . 	
ES2016c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	So that 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217		
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Alright . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Okay . 	
ES2016c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Let's do it . 	
ES2016c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216
