IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I'll help talk . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um yeah so what we ended up with . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	someone forgot the units there 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Unit price . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	yeah , uh unit price 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	unit production price cost thing . Um 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	we implemented the basic functions , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	which was one of the marketing things , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	cradle , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	scroll wheel for uh the the channels , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Scrolling through your favourites list . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Oh okay okay . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Zapping you know zapping . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And um yeah that was the result . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Ah 'kay . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I like the the the the logo on there as well . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	It's very prominent . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	It is very prominent . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So this is the 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	So 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	here I'll give you the 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	so this is the cradle unit , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	and this is the actual remote itself . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	um and then the volume controls are here and here . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	This is the power button . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh we have our um 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	we have the enter button 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and uh what was the other button here ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	This is the teletext . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Start s the 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	the start uh to to to 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	The programme button , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	programme yeah . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	yeah the programme button . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Ah , okay I see . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	and the red area is like a rubber covering . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So you can see that when it lays like this or like this 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	It's pretty cool . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Is that 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Not helping . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	and it depends on if it's sliding , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	but I think it's pretty ergonomic . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	You can feel it . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm . Feels good . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah of course . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Well this is clay . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah it's kinda cool . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	You have to reach a little bit don't you . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	These this is a bit larger than it would be , but 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	It's cool . I'm impressed . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Don't have no one to handle that . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mm that's 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	And hold it so 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	wh what's the marketing perspective ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	oh that's 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	oh I like it . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	because we've got some really marketable features in this . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah I think it's good . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Good good good job . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Beep beep beep . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh pla 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	The locator function . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I'm ha 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um beep beep beep 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Mm it's impressing . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Wicked isn't it ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So let me get it , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	so 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	if I press this button 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	beep beep beep 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	I see . That's pretty cool . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Hang on . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	beep beep beep 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	be shut up . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Beep beep beep 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	I plan to do that as well . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	okay . Um no no no tha that's alri 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Exactly that's exactly what those are for . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Ah okay okay . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	is um you could 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	beep beep beep 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Right . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	but 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh , I can see that . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	hasn't it ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yep I like . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Good job . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	No no . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	The hmm . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Careful . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It came off . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Well I mean of course , I mean 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	You know some blend of silvers and blacks . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Beep beep beep . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay enough of that . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Well i it's cool guys . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Ja . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Now now . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I gotta do mine up at the board . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Have you ? Okay . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	So 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Oh I see I see . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	and I think I've got this really strange cable . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Nah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So what we had is we had the method . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	That's not how you spell method , is it ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	No way . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	No A_ . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	. 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So this doesn't go so fast this way . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	We've got the features , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	we have the uh characteristics , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and we have the 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I I don't know what we would call the other part 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	what we call you know the the the corp corporate 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Help me . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	So the features I think 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	It fell off . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Beep beep beep . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	the characteristics I talk about , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Uh and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	We're wanting to make a name for ourself . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	That was something I would be interested in . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Um so yeah 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um w 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Do you 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	um I I m 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	But you guys came up with a great product , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Hmm . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	but you follow what I'm s I'm s 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	We we w yeah 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	we could get another version of it that actually works . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	But uh 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	but that's that was just an idea I had . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Uh to me the only additions 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yep . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Mm there's a risk of that . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	But anyway that's uh 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay so we can talk about finance now . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So I have a little spreadsheet for us 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	where 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I I was wondering , you 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Okay 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Very co very colf colourful . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Now 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Oh . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Uh-huh . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	equivalent to solar cells , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Uh-huh . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	the you know the 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	beep beep beep . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Can be made for 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	it sounded different that time 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Oh , sorry . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	uh an uh 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	. 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Okay . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yep . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	And we and we have a single-curved uh 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh I think that 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I don't know whether that . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	It's single-curved , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	You think ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Okay 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I'm convinced . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	So yeah it's fifteen point eight , 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	that's where we came up with it . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Well hang on . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Do don't speak so 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Okay . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	it's in here , in that 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	w do we have any 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	we have special form don't we ? 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah we do . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So that's yeah . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Ah . What do you know . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	But the the the 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	we haven't talked about any special colour though 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	uh I don't th 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	O okay so we're 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	If th . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	We don't 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It's a scroll . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	That's a scroll . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Just a scroll ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Uh no we just use it as a scroll . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Ooh . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Okay 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	then we have fifteen point eight Euros . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It wasn't bad . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yes . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	We're wicked . Awesome . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Okay so 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	we're on to the 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell How's it going ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Anyone got any thoughts ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	What ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	How how have we done today ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I think we did pretty well . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	I think we did pretty well too . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	That looks pretty spectacular . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Any other chang uh thoughts ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	That was mm-hmm 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Is it the . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Sh I think there was plenty of room . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	We got a couple innovative i 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	well we we we kinda broke 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Couple innovative ideas . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	No . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Not every idea necessarily , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Basically . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	it's still a remote control . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118		
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Uh no 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	but the uh 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	But I like 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yep . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	I agree . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Teamwork . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Cohesive yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Synergy . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yes synergistic yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	There was a lot of synergy . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Teamwork , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	yeah he is uh . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	What did we think of the meeting room , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	I guess is an important thing here . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	These cables suck . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Mm . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , this falls off 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	and uh the white board worked really well without any pro 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yep . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	And that's 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	D you must have very long shirts . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	That's way far down lapel mic . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Mm-mm , lapel . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Lapel lapel lapel . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Wha okay , oh , alright . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Lapel . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	That's almost a crotch mi cr 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	That's it's down , it's quite close . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Keep it , keep it calm . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Oh dear oh dear . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Oh dear . No more pizza for me . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So yeah the the pen came in alright 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	'Cause this is you were using it o upside down . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Still that 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	That's our boss . 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	but see these look like they're 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Use them like that . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Pedro's right . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Pedro's right . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	I don't care . 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . 	
IS1002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	What new ideas have we found ? 	
IS1002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Oh wel 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or 	
IS1002d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	what are we ta 	
IS1002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Well let's do both then .
