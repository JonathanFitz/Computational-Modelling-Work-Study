IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm-hmm 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	So , ready ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	No not really 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	'Kay 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Just 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Crap . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Sorry , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	I I um 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	It's perfect . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Your judgement it's is biased . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I'm afraid 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	'Kay , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	so whe where is the remote control ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Where ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	we are 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	It's here . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	So 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	let's go for our detailed design meeting . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yep . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	So I will still play the role of the secretary , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	and 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	'Kay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And in case 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I have slides . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	You have s 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	oh , sorry . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Oops . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Ah , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Effectively one slide 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	and maybe we can discuss everything . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Product prod 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	What slides ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yep . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So , this is our product or prototype . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	This is made by clay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Looks strange . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yellow is uh our company colour , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	uh red it's uh is more attractive . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And the shape , there's two basic shape . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It's 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	we call it a mushroom design . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So this is a introduction of our product . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Next a mo 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	keep on speaking . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	yeah , so next slide . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So there are several key features of our pr prototype . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	The first is that it is fuzzy . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Oh . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , yeah I'm sure . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Maybe , I hope so . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah , that's true . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um , and uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Chan 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah , okay , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah , s 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	uh so it's it's um 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	it's unlikely you cannot found it . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	and there's some cute button . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Everything's mushroom . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah , everything's mushroom . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So we can call our remote control the mushroom . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Mush 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Mushroom design , yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	centre is yellow and t d 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	To integrate , you know yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I don't think 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I hope nobody will eat it 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	you know the the in 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Oh . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Really ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Fruits and vegetables . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	But 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Fruit and vegetable , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	so mushroom was a kind of you know uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I don't think it is . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	It's vegetable . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Mushroom ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Oh , uh I'm not sure . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	So th it's something eatable . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	We can 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	it's a veg a kind of vegetable , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	but you know we we integrated them with different colour . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	No , I mean , yeah yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Inspira inspiration is 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And inspired colour 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and and very sophisticated material , so . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	True . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	And so 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Next slide . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Uh , no this our only two slides . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So what we w 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	what I can add is that , you know 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	he talk about what is outside , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	it is a low level chip , and 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	So we cut it to see . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	You know , we don't need to k . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	You know wi 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	the low level chips inside 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So where's the battery battery ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	The battery it is under . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	It is in th in in the base , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	In the base . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Base . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	In the basement . In the basement . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Here ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	And where is the solar solar cell ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	But we say uh we sa we said solar . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Where is the solar cell ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Oh . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I don't think so , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay , we'll see after . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	but it it's might be okay , so . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	We will have first to 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I it might be okay . So 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	instead of just talking about uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	and first one was uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	fancy look and feel . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	one being uh no , I think . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh just let me check . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	One one being true , and seven being false . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Oops . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Ouch . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah , I think so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	I think you have nice colours . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I don't 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	But is it 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	The sha the bowl shape people like . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah , the shape is unique , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	and the colour 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh I'll agree it's unique , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	but is it really 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Is it really fancy ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So it depend on how d do you define fancy . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	But it's 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Do Don't do that , please . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	and maybe do things like that 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I dunno where the lemon is , but 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I mean it's not obvious . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	It would be bet more like a lemon ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	If 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Because i 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Less button . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	so , my mush . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Looks like more fruit . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah , but you don't have any button now . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Mm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Maybe a pineapple ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I dunno . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Hmm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	That's uh yeah , is that 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah , it's getting 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	that's a good idea . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So that's great . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	It looks more like a pineapple . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	That's great . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Sorry . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	What's the use for that ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Uh , for turn turn the ball . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	I have no idea , so . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I have no idea what 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And where is the voice recognition ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Uh . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah , that's 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Th this th th there's two two functions . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Wait th that's the second point . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	This is microphone array 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	If it is fancy or not . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Is it better like that ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I mean 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So we can we can say t 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Looks okay , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	let's say it's a pineapple now . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	The colour , is the colour acceptable ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	No , the colour is okay , that's fine . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	So the shape now . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I mean it's 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It looks like a 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	but I would say there is more too much red . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	now you took it . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	It's too much red ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um if 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	In the basement ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Right . So , from one to seven ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I will give I will 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Seven is the ma the maximum ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	No , seven is false and one is true . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I'll gi 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I'll give two or three . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Three , it's okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Three , I will say three . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Three , three . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Three ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Three is fine for me . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	'Kay 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Three . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Isn't it bitter like that ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Then uh let me 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	What other 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Is it easy to use ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Feasible ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Ye uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Embedded . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	It's a micro array , okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	There four microphone . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oh . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So they they they they there's a microphone array . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	and you have the 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So you can capture voice yeah , you c 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Oh yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	W Yeah , but 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	We have tactile buttons . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	I see , you have microphone array embedded . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	You have 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	No , that's good . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	That's good . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Oh , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , th that's another really good point . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Maybe okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	I think technically it's acceptable , so 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Maybe two ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So using the same scale , two ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Two ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I would say two 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	. You agree ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , I agree . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	It's better like that , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Now maybe the most critical one . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	isn't it ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Most 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	L last one w I would like to judge is 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	is it easy to use ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	But it's just speaking . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah , it's very easy . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	You just need the command . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah but this this turning 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	You can use this in this way . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	can you can you just re explain me the 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	As a principle . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Please . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Th this is the base . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	So you can turn to change the channel . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	You just tu turn d d 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I think maybe if you he 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Like if you want to go from 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Oh , ok I understand . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	If you hear some click 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	You take take the remote , so 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and you can turn like that to change the channel ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah but imagine you y 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	but maybe it will be too fast . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	No , no , no . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	I if y uh if 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	it depend on the the angle you turn the 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . I agree . I agree . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah but y how 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	But I mean if you're fro from two ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	you need to know I 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I think something that 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So change . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	And you you can 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Oh yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	We're not talking 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	So you got how many degree you you it 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I think you can if you have a scale , so 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	No no , you don't have to y no 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	it's uh when you when you stop t uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	when you stop , the the turn , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So you you count one degree , two degrees , no . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I don't think so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah , it's a bit difficult . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	I think so I think so you can do it . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I think so , you can just change . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah voc vocal command is okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	There's uh also a number , you know . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	so you're passing through all the channels . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And this would be more for browsing , ah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	To see uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	yeah uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Seems to be good . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Good choice , mister David Jordan . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah , I mean you're famous . You . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	And but I'd 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	And also you can , if you i 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	yeah , what's what's this cherry ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	You ca you can turn this . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Or you ca you can you can also turn this . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	For this you can tune it's for tune . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Mm . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It's like fine , from coarse to fine . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	This is coarse , this is fine . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , yeah yeah . That's 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	So it's coarse to fine design . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	that's very technologic , so . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah is is 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	This is from one channel to 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	maybe one of the 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Uh it's k 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	On off . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	on off , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Most of the time you have the 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	yeah it's a sleeping remote control . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah , sleeping . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	That's true . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	W that why we have the solar ti yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Solar . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	To compensate . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	So 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	So , which number ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	three . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Easy to use , it's very relative 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	but three it's fine , I think , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	it's reasonable three . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Do you agree ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah , agree , agree . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Three ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	So reasonably , is four , is one ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	So , three . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Four or three . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	and no and just take the mean . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	And what's your opinion ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Will you give four ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Five ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah , so maybe if 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Uh w w what do y what uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I think it's easier than traditional controller . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	you have you just turn the turn the ball . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah but y you know 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	There's two kind of balls , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	So you have 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	You just push two button , zero and and one . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	And that's 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Are there some buttons ? Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	It's not what you said previously . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Previously you said that turning this was the fine 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , if you're changing your mind . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Fine to coarse . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Fine to coarse . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	And from ten to ten channels here . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Uh there's different scale , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	But this this has to stay on the table , right ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	This has to stay on the table . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	In fact on a flat place 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	I i this is just a base . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	You can just 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	You can 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Oh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Oh ye yes , that's right . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Just 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	It's 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It's just your turning from the base . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	You need to have everything in hand . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Oh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	It's impossible . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	You need to put it on and turn . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	You know tha that's the weak point , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	You use your y 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	because with a traditional one you just have one hand . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	my God . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	So th this is a d next generation controller . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Nobody would take it . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Sure . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So nobody w will lost lose it . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	yeah maybe , maybe may 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Okay okay , okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	it's the next prototype , maybe we cou 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	S maybe we can change from th 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Four . Maybe four , it's okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Four . Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Four ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	I'll put four . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Easy to use , four . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Gonna say four . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Four . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , four it's more reasonable . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Uh it's even easier to maybe . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	You can you can erase with this er yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Ok 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	So it's nine , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	So , average ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	nine over three . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Three ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Three ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Trois . Three . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Oh yeah , it's . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Trois . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay , so 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	It need maybe some wo further work , but it's 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah , especially on the easy to use 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , uh s yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	target . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Might it might be fine . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	So , th the project is accepted ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah , b I think 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	So uh mm mm . Mm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	That's the finance . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Mm . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	So 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	we need to calculate the production cost . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Oh yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	So , just have a look at the okay here is the 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Excel sheet , so 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	so it has the energy source . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	We have hand dynamo . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	No , we don't use that . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	No . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	We have battery , right ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah , we have battery . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	No , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	um solar cells , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	but we have solar cells . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Do you think one would be enough , or such as 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Uh I think in each ball you have three 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	as number of branches ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Three ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	three uh yeah , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	three , yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Three three solar cells . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	electronic . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Single simple chip on print ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Just one would be necessary ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	S s simple , simple , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	One ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Zero for the others . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	And sample sensor , sample speaker . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	One ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Mm . One maybe , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	As we have voice recognition , I think . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	So the case . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Is it 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Is sh it 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	So we are all already nineteen . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Wooden . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Okay , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	just keep on going , just to have an idea . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	The solar cell is too expensive . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Well uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	yeah , but what what about case ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	I think it's more like double curved . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	That's gonna be double curved , yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Double curve , yeah , double curve . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	One ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	One , you have . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Uh wood ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	But it's yeah , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Rather four buttons . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	a a rubber uh 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Oh no , interface . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Uh do we need special colour ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Y maybe , two ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	We have two special colours . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Push button . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Mm . Yeah , we have four . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Five . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Five ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Scroll wheel . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	No . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	We don no . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	It it's more like integrated scor . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	No no . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah tha that's wheel . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Y you tu you turn you turn it , so 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	No no no , it 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	So , no button supplements ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	I think the price is okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	No . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Um , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	no . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Okay we I think we have problem . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	I think we s if we keep on adding things 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	It's okay . fine . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	so we have to 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Has it changed . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah , it was stage one , so . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	No y i it did change , but 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	just imagine we have 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	So 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	but we have you the the voice recognition , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	no ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah it's the one it's 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	m maybe we ha we have two versions , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	the first version , the basic version . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Advanced version we have speak . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Because uh it seems that this can be 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah , if 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Or it would be better . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Plastic is free . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So , do we need special colour ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah , that's one of the requirement . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Because we have red . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah , red and yellow . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Wait . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Red and yellow . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Fancy . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	We we can we can we c 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	yellow . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Black then is a regular colour , so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	I think so we need if we try to have a kind of 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah , one . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	pineapple bee . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	And I think this is one . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah , thi this might be . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Integrated scroll wheel push button 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	. So we'll we have only one ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	And push button . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Close to . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	One . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	I can remove 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	How about we change the sale ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Double curved . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Something flat . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	F some 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , but flat 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Single curve . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Case , what's the ca 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Single curve should be fine , so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Oh , what 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Mm . Nearly . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Ah we have one 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	And then one Euro left . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Um . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	It's it's a bad idea , so . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Um 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	I think there's a problem with the push push button . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	We only need maybe just one . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Two ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	One . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Just one . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	That's fine . That's fine . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Okay . Okay . Agree . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	So we have one button , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	So yeah , you will have 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	One s one scroll wheel , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	one wheel . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	So one button , and s 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	scroll wheel with push button on it . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	And the vocal chord , it's fine . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	It I th it's fine . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	So 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	It's good they're not charging anything for that . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Cou could we have look 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	twelve fifty e 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yeah , but it's under or equal . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	It's not written . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	It's fine . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Sometimes it's under or equal . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	It's under or equal . It's fine , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	So let's say 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Twelve fifty . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Wha what 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	It's fine , twelve fifty uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Which part is the most expensive part ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Solar cells . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	The solar cells , r is i is it ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah , I think . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah , I think it's not t t 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	I think , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Cheaper . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	That's nice argument , 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	but if it's it's still four our of twelve . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah , with mi 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Maybe if uh okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah but we just have one button . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Easy . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	I don't know about powerful . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Easy , powerful . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Mm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	No . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Uh that's what we've just done . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Um 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	So 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Now 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	So 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	So 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Well I think we have just have to discuss if 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Okay , okay , it's fine . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	I dunno . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yes . Of course . This is my job . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Yeah , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	And for the marketing guy ? 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yep . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Okay , okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	And new ideas about new products , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	and yellow . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Yellow . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	It can be an interesting I don't know 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yes , just lemon . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	It's flat , uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah yeah it's flat , 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Squared ? 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	yeah the shape is very boring . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . Because the T_V_ you also 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Oh , that's interesting . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Device devi 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	The fruit ? Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Maybe 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Yeah , it's 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Maybe two years it's dead . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Mm . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Yeah , yeah . That's a yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	fifteen years 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Customable T_V_ . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Ah such yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	You've already said mobile phones . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yeah , you can keep the global appearan 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah , and following 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	The mood of persons , the fashions uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Mm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	We int 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222

IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Uh-huh . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Twenty five Euros . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Twenty five Euros , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Yeah , I think it's 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.311	It should be fine . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Twenty five Euros . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	It's maybe a little bit expensive . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	It's cheap , yeah . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	No , I 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280	No , it's not so expensive . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Wh really ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.313	It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . S 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229		
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.314		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.282		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.315		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.317	I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	No , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.318	It's perfect , and 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	True . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.319	I p is th y 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.320	the the yellow ball thing that 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Uh 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Still that was one of the requirements we had . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Mm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Mm . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.286	So we have to give a 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	so we have the slogan too . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.287	So we have give him give it a cute name . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Cute na 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Yeah 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Mush mushroom controller . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.323	It's not a mushroom . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	It's not the trend . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.324	It's a pineapple remote controls . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Pa 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Pineapple . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Pine apple . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah , but just flying saucer , or 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	With cherry on top . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Oh , that 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Okay . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	I would say flying saucer . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	It's more appropriate , somehow . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Okay . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.328	That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.316		
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Mm . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Okay .

IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Try to . Okay uh 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Twenty five Euro . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.330	. I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Okay . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah I always lose my 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.298	so you need to buy one . 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Okay . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Mm . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240

IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.301	So this one and this one . What do you choose ? 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	I prefer the laser remote control . No . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256		
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.333	I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's 	
IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.302	What do you choose ?

IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . 	
IS1003d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . 	
IS1003d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . 	
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Yeah .

IS1003d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226		
IS1003d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
