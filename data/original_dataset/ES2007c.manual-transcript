ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Oh right okay . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I cover myself up . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	I feel like Madonna with one of these on . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	. 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I've always wanted one of these , I really have . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Where do you buy 'em from ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	They're . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Right . Hello everybody . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Hello . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Back again for another wonderful meeting . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Is uh everyone ready ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Almost . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	we c we can hold on for a minute . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh my gosh . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Are you ready ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay , right , well , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I take it that you are all ready now . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	and who we all are and stuff like that , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Hmm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Do you have any preference uh of order ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um I'd like to um hear 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I want 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Batteries . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	I think she is still finishing her . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It's just that 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Hmm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Where is that thing ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay , it's uh 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	It's here . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Oh sorry , couldn't see . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Would that work ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Get yourself in position . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay , so that's me again . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Ah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	if you remember that kind of 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	I don't think any of us remember the fifties . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Is it like a crank thing or something . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	It wouldn't be very fancy . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	You can have a kinetic provision of energy , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	which is used on some watches these days . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Or you can use solar cells , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I dunno actually . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Does anybody know ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I dunno . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Okay . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Mm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	but I don't know if it's worth the cost . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So we've got to discuss that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay , jolly good . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	if you know what I mean , so 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	What's a double curved one ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	so we just have to take that into account . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So that might be an idea of using the rubber , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	but then it should , you know 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Let's have a squeezable remote . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I dunno 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	when a T_V_ programme's got one 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah , I like that idea . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	So rubber would be Okay . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	I think rubber's 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	You think you can market that ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Uh s so if d 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	People . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	okay . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	And then there are the push-buttons , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um scroll buttons , as well . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Uh-huh . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So it's a constraint . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	If that makes sense . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	push buttons instead of the wheel ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	it doesn't matter if it's double 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	rubble double double . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	I'll have a Big Mac , please . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And that's 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	I dunno why , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So , either 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I dunno 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	we just need to decide on the on the case . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Okay . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Let's go crazy . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And then , do I have a last slide ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yes , I do . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um and the price that go with it with it , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Simple , yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Chip on print . It's a bit . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	. 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	The infra-red . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Right . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Y um 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	It's less expensive mm 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	so it sounds 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So , why would we not go for that ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Fo 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Totally . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um we wanna go for an i i all 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So let's not go for the 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	so long as it works , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , yeah . I agree . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	you know . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	S yeah , push buttons . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I think push-buttons is 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	What about what ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Well 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm , I dunno . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Be cool . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Channel two . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	S 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	'cause uh 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	where , basically , you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	and you program the response as well . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	But , I mean , it's not 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Hm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	but it's not that . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	It just gives you 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Oh , it just gives an answer . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	a it just gives you a verbal response . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Oh , then then 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	I thought I thought it was when they said 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Just if you are really lonely , maybe . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Channel five . And then it switches on . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	channel five , and it will change . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	No , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	tha that w that w that would be more promising . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Like you talk to it . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Can I have channel five ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	It it's just a remote that talks to you . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh . I mean to certain cues . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Oh , then forget about it . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Oh right okay . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	'Kay . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Basic battery . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Hmm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Cheaper option . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Are you happy with that ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Okay . So we'll go for the battery . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	so we want it rub rubber double curved . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	The the 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So it will look like something like this . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Double ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	The double whopper , please . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yep , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	but 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	we're going for the simple buttons . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	So rubber rubber keys , yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	and that's fine ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And it's cheapest all round , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	it sounds kinda funky , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	and we can also market it 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	P 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	as i 'cause we were s saying earl 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	. 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So that's another marketing point that we can use . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Well the rubber push-buttons . Don't you have to move your 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	But anything is gonna have buttons . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	You 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	That they don't . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	. 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	It's not actually what you are doing . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah , the rubber's good . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah , so they can sit there and go like 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Alright , that's me done . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Alright . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Alright . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Great . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Sorry . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Mm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	It's it's pointless . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Mm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Mm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Um so we've already addressed that 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	That does get annoying . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um the other suggestion , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	and I I have a feeling that 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	we're interested in in something more general , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	like either gearing our remote towards kids , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	But you know we can we can discuss this , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Uh um 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So , the key layout and design are really crucial . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	You don't want uh 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	uh 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	from our manufacturing department . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So this would be an example of bad layout , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	it's sort of confusing for the user . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Do we have an uh example of a good one ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Brilliant . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Uh-huh . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Well 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And for something for kids . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . Um . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	And so , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I think it should be more general . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	And , yeah , that's it for me . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Okay . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Well let's um 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	The um 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	The the um the interface type we're going for 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Uh . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	And some sort of 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Okay , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	and we're not yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well now that we've decided on our 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Are we gonna hav hav an are we d 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	have we decided on whether 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	we're not we're just gonna go for something 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	We're 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Maybe we can 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	but um 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Let's move over to 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	. 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	But I think that should be 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	I mean um , I can speak with the button department , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	So that should be simple . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Cool . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Right . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Mm yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	and what the fashions are for next year . Um . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So yes , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	so from looking at this year's trends and fashions 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	which we've already probably discussed . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um the most important aspect is look and feel . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So it has to be 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yep . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Exactly . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	What's that mean ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Should 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	That's new . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Okay , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	'cause our rubber one is not fancy 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	And it's it's not technologically innovative either . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So , no loose 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Maybe we could um 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	like people 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Of course , they do . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Well , they do , but it's like it's not 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah , but it looks good . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Okay , well , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	what do you two think about this ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	But like 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	electronics ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah , what I don't understand what m 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	You could always insert , yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	right ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	and it this is just gonna 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	all this is being used for is your television . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah , but , I mean , people like 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	It would 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Well 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	does it ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Things like that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	No , that would be your telephone in with your television . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	No i 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I mean 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	and i 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	I with the television , yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	I was just trying to find an advantage . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Mm . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Wha what w what advantage would you get for the 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Well , it doesn't 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	An and there is no there is no such thing 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	that was just an idea , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Whether it's a battery 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	it could be something really really minor , you know , like 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Okay . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	and um just go creative . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay . Yeah , this that's that's very good . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	And then you can market it . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Never have to change a battery again . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Change the batteries ever again . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	And and this is all tying in very nicely . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yes , so can 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I think , safety s 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	But yeah , by the squeezing it the 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	we're all about that . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	And I think we've all um worked that out . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So next year people will be buying , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I found this really funny , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	you know , strawberry shaped chairs , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Rubber things . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	I wanna watch the pineapple channel . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Um 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	. 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Well spongy , that's where . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah , that's great for us . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	yeah , so we're in . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	while still keeping to the company's image , basically . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	. I had to say 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	So we're moving in the right direction like 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Right . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	so through all that we've we go we're 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yep . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah , that's great . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	that's great , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	using the spongy rubber that we were talking about 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Mm . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	No vegetables . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	. 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143		
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Some sort . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Uh-huh . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Or 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	The power button could be like a big apple or something . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah , this is true . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	They don they don't own all images of apples . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	sued the Beatles so 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	. 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Well 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I think , if it's rubber it needs to be 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	different . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I think , it's it should be 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	You know like 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	L keep it clean , keep it clean . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	really different colours basically . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Um 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Bright natural colours , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	nothing too 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Bright , but not too bright . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Bright , but too not 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	And on the back of it have the logo . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	what ? 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Sure . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Why not ? 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Okay . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Tha 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah , 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	I mean we that's we we 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	This is the remote control tomato . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Well 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Like 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220		
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	I'm gonna write that down . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	so it's rea it's quite 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170		
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	it's quite like um user friendly 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152		
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	and also for different families , like like family use as well , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the 	
ES2007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	That's yeah . 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Mm . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So they also get to pick .

ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , 	
ES2007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	It's um 	
ES2007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
