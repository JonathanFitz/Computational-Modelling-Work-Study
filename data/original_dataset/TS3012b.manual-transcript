TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	welcome again . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Today , functional design phase . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	that was just to get to know each other , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	so if you wanna review them , they're there . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	I will do so after every meeting , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Anyways , um 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	today three presentations , from every one of you . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	so we're gonna go af go after over this later . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	so we can see what everybody came up with . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	And after that we can have the new requirements 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and share some thoughts , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Who would like wanna go first ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Yeah , sure , no problem . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Go ahead . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Take it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um there was a little problem with my computer 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	so not uh the whole uh presentation uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Anyway , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	let's see what you have . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Uh it's still a bit open . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	I want to open the my s 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	oh no . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah . So there ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Oh no , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	that's okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Uh slide show . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yes . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	The functional requirements , it's uh uh very important for uh the user , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	he he wants to 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	because it went wrong , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and uh what what's uh important . Uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	If I can cut in , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	is it people or men ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	People , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	sorry . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Is it people , okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Both women and men , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	'Cause I thought it was only men , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	so 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Okay . Uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	'Kay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	the findings um uh 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	That's pretty shocking uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	So we have to s we have to do something about that . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	most th th 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	um uh fifty percent say they only 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	So 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	that's the most important things . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Um oh yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	just talk ahead . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Uh less important is tel teletext , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	uh um they use it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	but it's not uh very uh important 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Okay , that's okay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	and 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but not important is the channel selection , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	the the 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	hmm ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	That's a little weird . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Oh , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Which channel selection ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	the the 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	no no no no no , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	that's very important , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	we can we can hide those under a menu or something , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Oh , okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um new preferences preferences . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Uh um um beep to find your control , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	was 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	That's like a button on your T_V_ ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Remote , okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Okay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Is that manageable ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	That sounds too 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	It's possible , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	but uh I think it's expensive , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	but do continue . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah . Um 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	so I can uh I dunno , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	wh what I uh 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	so , the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	you don't set it yourself , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	so I can zap t to 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	What ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	You want the you want it to be programmed , for example 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	y programmed f 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Recognise 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Let's see , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	so it recognises your favourite channel . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Okay , so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	it's it it does 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	it recognise itself , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	you don't have to set it 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	No , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	itself . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Maybe it's easier to to sell it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I don't know it's manageable , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	but we will uh we will see . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	I see . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	it's a little bit 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	uh it's the end of it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	It's a little bit uh I lost it , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Okay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	the computer uh crashed , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	No problem , it's it's okay , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	that's 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Shall I go ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah , go ahead . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	So , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	some technical functions . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Darn computer . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Uh let's just start with the method . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	It sounds really easy , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	but there are quite some issues . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	We can do that . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	What goes wrong at the user . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Gets the remote control . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Where is the remote control ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	We've all had it once , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	I want to watch some television , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	where's the remote control ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	That was one of your ideas 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	which you posted in the network folder , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	That seems very good . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	a really good idea . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Uh these are just the issues . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Searches for the button . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Uh so either we lose those 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	or we try to make it a little bit more clear . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Mm uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	because you don't know which channel is this button , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	so possibly we could find uh something for that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Okay , so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	have it more make it more durable actually . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	yes . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Okay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Uh covered that . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Oh yes , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	user presses the button . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Okay , so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	the buttons should be 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Wow . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	The s 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . Make it make them bigger . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	si 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Even more durable uh . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	uh so 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	clear we should stick to existing symbols , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . Uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Okay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	This I pretty much covered . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	So what we want to go to is not this one , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah , it's true . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	that's basically uh what I had in mind . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah , that's clear . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	This is not the final design , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	No , of course uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	I must say that it 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	that was it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	That was it . Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	that was good . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	and increase it the durability of of the thing , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	so 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	and what's possible for that budget . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay , that's fine . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Um . Okay , now 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	work a little with me . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Okay . Well , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	let's start it as it is . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Okay , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Which buttons are wanted , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	uh is our remote control universal 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	or should it be programmable . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I'll tell you why that's important to me . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	So 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah . Of course , hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	that's not as easy as it s might look like . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	I have to check out how far I can go with that . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	uh and the wires are made of copper . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Uh that is how it is done 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and all the remote controls work that way , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I think we can just go on with that . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Exactly , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	So you have 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	so this is not the entire thing . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	You have the the power coming in , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	then you have like a switch . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	that's how you should see it . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	The Morse code goes to the amplifier , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	You have infrared 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	and an interv 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	um uh how to say it ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	That makes it much more complex , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	That was it ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	That was it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	I'll get back to my thing then . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Uh Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	back this up to the screen . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	I got some new information on the project specifications 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	are changing a little . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	because the uh the internet , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	so it can either 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Well , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	I don't think we should remove the button , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	because there are always people who are using it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	It's not important anymore . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Um we're targeting young people now , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	because our um 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	which are 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	um the younger people were defined under forty . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	I so I think it's 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	B 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	that's also good with the fashion and everything , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	so yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	and they want to pay for it 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	and uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	With more Where 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	with more technical specifications 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	in the 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	see how far we can go with it anyway , so 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	which is apparently black and yellow , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	but I'm not sure if we 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I think we should keep the the logo in mind , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	and just make changeable covers for your 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Oh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	I mean those cost hardly anything I think , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Or we can sh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	for example we can make a different a basic design . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	And sell the covers separately , for example . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	so you can p 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	it appeals to really everyone . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	We make a basic one 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	and manufacture this cover separately . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	just 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Would you like to share ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	No , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	I think this is a good idea . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	But 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	But oh ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Go ahead . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	with with an L_C_D_ screen you can 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Oh yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Y Yes , I think so too . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	like you said . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Why ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Nokia w 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	it consumes batteries like hell . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	And it costs too much to fabricate , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	It costs a lot , I think . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	so we're on a tight budget here . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Okay , uh 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	For example , a little T_V_ guide . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Like you have a little 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	I'm not sure it's even possible , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	I have to check that out , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	but maybe okay , make it 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I'm not sure . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	find a little compromise in that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	but 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	What did I write down ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	just make a button on your T_V_ 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	That must be possible . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	I think it's easy to implement , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Ja . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	we should go for that . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I'm sorry , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Uh speech recognition . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	we want a button on the television . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	I thin 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	I mean where else should you put it ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	In th 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	okay , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	but that rules out a universal remote control . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Because that's not possible uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	but how are you gonna use that if your 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Uh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Exactly . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	A slap-on sticker . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Oh , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm uh . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah , exactly . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah , that could be possible . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Okay , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	If not 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Okay . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	I think universal remote control should be possible . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Um 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Okay , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Everyone uh wants to buy it , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	then I go for that . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	so we w 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	I think we're targeting everyone , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	so remote 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	No , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	it's fine with me , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	but then I know what to look for . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Okay , universal is good . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	because we're selling across multiple countries . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Or one . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	And it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	right ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	But 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Oh yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	so that is a problem in implementing this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	It's 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	It's not a mature technology , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	It's a good idea , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	so 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Uh-huh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	What else do we have ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Um well 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	So the the the symbols won't fade , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	maybe a little harder plastic 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Exactly . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	I already noted that . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	or especially li we don't 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Mm , okay . Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	so those always fade first . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Let's see . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	That's fo is 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	For example ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Well , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	we're not we're not targeting older people , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	we should remember that . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Everything we target is under forty , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	That's 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	okay , okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	You assume that that they read correctly 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	and I think they're 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Huh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	But b 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Uh okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	so 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	or just the 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	No , of course . No , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	I think it's just something you you put over them , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	because 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	But every 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	C 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	that's a problem with the with the text then . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	it's not even a bad idea . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	So it's a good and a bad idea . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	so you don't have to change your whole cover . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Know what I mean ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Oh . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Oh yeah , I know what you mean . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	It works the same as a Nokia telephone , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	it's it's in my uh 'kay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah , I know , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Exactly . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	okay . Yeah , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	that's what I 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	something I have to look into . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I'm not sure which which is easier , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Um anyway , yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	this is what we're gonna do afterwards , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	just lunch break and have more individual work after that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	so let's see what we let's see we 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	you have to come up with a components concept , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	I want some 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	you should do some trend-watching , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Um Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	I think user interface is fairly obvious . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	I mean it should be very intuitive , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Pretty straightforward . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	s 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	it should speak for itself . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	it was it l it's like all buttons 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	and you have no idea what it does at first , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	I think it should be have less or l very little buttons 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	just stick 'em under one menu 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	and uh give it a 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	just put it in in s in a software piece , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	because we're working with different types of television , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	so we're going to work with that ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	That is true . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	I don't think so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	No , that's true . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	No , I don't think so . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Because the television needs to respond to the signal , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	It's an in-built menu , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	and if it doesn't know how , it's 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	isn't it ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yes . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Exactly , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	that's not possible . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	So basically 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	we 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	I'm not sure if it's impossible , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	but uh there's a chance it's not , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	so . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	you 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	A double-sided remote control ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	I don't think that's useful . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	with the cover . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	because 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	No , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	but basic functions 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	but functions which are not frequently used . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	I don't think we should 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	for exam 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	so 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Mm yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	I'm not s 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	for ex 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	But that might be broken . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	'Cause everybody 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	I have a universal remote control 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	and it can use the menu button , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	so I think 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	I'm not sure , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Uh I think just a b 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Mm okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	and the navigation is very basic , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	it's usually the same thing . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think so 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	I think it's possible , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	just the way how to . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	I thi I think so too . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	then then you could do everything I suppose , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	so it's okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	and you always grab the wrong one 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	We should not do that . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Exactly . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	because it's either it's both mayb 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I have some ideas . I have some ideas . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	maybe the shape can be a little different . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Um yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Mm that's your uh division . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	And uh with different colours uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	So um 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	I'll put some on paper 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	Not sure what 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	because we have forty minutes , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	so . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	I heard a beep go . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	but it wasn't me , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	it was him closing something . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	So anyway , yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	I mean what do you want , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	do you want , but 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	but we like some some curves 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	or 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	may maybe something like this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	But though smooth inside . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	So you have the transmitter here for example . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	Let's see that you what would be handy . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Uh . And a light uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	Let's see 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	one , two 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	God damn it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Oh , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	we get the general ideas , yes . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	Another one here . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	Let's see what 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	I think this should 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382	these are always on top of the of the control , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	so they should be here . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	Think it's like this . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Volume . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	Withi within the 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	yeah yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	just take it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	you have the up channel the down channel 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	Do you take triangles 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.389	or 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Uh it's it's fine , I think . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.390	Um I think it should be I think it 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	This is basically what people are accustomed to , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.391	Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	but this is just a g general idea . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Oh d 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.392	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.393	Yeah , in the middle . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.394	It's it's usually uh there , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.395	but 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Whoa . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.396	Mm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	They they won't hear the the beep . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	You won't be able to find it . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Uh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah , it's true , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Just 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	So . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	And L_E_D_ uh on it . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	deaf people ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	I thought about for deaf people for example , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.403	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.404	We could do that . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Just a light on it 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.405	Uh let's see . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	or 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	So we have the basic channels we've got here , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	uh the power button somewhere over here ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.406	Oh yeah , it's true . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.407	Um that thing should be central . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Very important . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.408	You shouldn't be 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.409	you uh shouldn't press it by accident , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.410	but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Oh , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	I usually press it on top . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	that's 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	It's 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	At least that's what I'm accustomed to . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.411	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	I have another idea , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.412	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.413	like that's gonna work . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	I'm not sure if it's possible . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	And 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	What would you like to ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.414	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.415	I thought maybe we should move the buttons down 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	But you r 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.416	and put it here for example 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	And you are reading from the t 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.417	to 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.418	From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	so it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.419	you should 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.420	I think the bu the power button should be on top , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.421	'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.422	So power button on top . Um 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Okay , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	mute button . Is that somewhere here ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.423	Mute . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.424	Do we hardly 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.425	I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Is that used often ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	So i it's 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	sorry ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	The mute button ? Do people use that often ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.426	Mute . Turn the sound off . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	No , it's no . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Uh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.427	I don't think it's important , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	It's not that important , no . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.428	but I think it I think it should be you c 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.429	you could put it somewhere here . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Or or with the volume selection . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.430	No , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.431	because it 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.432	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.433	people are accustomed to that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.434	it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.435	Can I have that ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	I don't know where exactly , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Sure . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.436	That's j 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.437	Take this out and here see 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.438	Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.439	I'm drawing triangles , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.440	but 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186		
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	aren't they ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.441	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.442	it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.443	So anyway , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.444	I think this is should be the channels 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.445	and or sh 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Wha 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Well , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	No . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.446	Here , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah , me too . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.447	okay . Okay , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah , that's better . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	On the right . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.448	should we chan 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.449	okay , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.450	this two , channel up and down . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	That you don't have to buy new batteries if every 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.451	Well , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.452	for that is it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.453	on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Maybe it's more ex expensive . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Mm , yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.454	Maybe we should what 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.455	what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.456	You have 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.457	just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	But that's already possible . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.458	because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.459	I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.460	but just take a look at it , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.461	because it might be a very good idea . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.462	Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yes . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.463	but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yes . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Okay . Uh 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	you could make a device , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	but it you're 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.464	I think I have a nice idea . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	the remote also can act as a recharger . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	So then you can choose , you have every decision . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Know what I mean ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.465	Not exactly uh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.466	I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	So but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.467	to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	that's g 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	But I think that will cost a lot . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Uh a normal wire would be better . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.468	I'm not sure . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.469	A what ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	you don't need basic station . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.470	Well , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.471	we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yes . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.472	or 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.473	So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	That is possible , that's true . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.474	It could be very flat , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	But Which 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.475	could be very small . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.476	It's a very small 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.477	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.478	I'm drawing it big now , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.479	but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.480	So you can put your remote on flat for example . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Mm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.481	And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.482	for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.483	I don't think it's very expensive . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	But again , isn't that too expensive ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196		
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.484	I'm not sure if it costs a lot , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.485	that that's what he r 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.486	That's that you 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.487	that's what you buy yourself . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yes . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	I'm going to try to find that out . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	I'm not sure if there's information available on this , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.488	It's just an idea , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	But 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.489	we have to find out if it's possible . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	but 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Yeah , they want to pay for it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.490	Do they want 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.491	but they want a rechargeable one ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.492	I'm not sure , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.493	you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Th uh there was not a el ask esque 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.494	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	But 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Well , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	this is comfort . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.495	They want to pay for comfort , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.496	we just assu we 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.497	we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	But f 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yes . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.498	um and Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.499	we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Yeah . Exactly . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	I think this is a brilliant product . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	I would buy it myself . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.500	I think it would be good actually . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.502	I like the beep part anyway . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.503	So um 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.504	let's go through the 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211		
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Can can we save this or 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I never thought 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.505	Covers is covers is good . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.506	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.507	it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.508	Oh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.509	we can save this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.510	Up and saved . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.511	We even saved the ant . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.512	Um Okay . So 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.513	what we have is you have 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.514	I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	I hope if I have information about that , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.515	Maybe 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	I'm gonna 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.516	yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.517	or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.518	We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216		
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.519	but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.520	because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Mm . Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.521	uh we just have to see what it looks like . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.522	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.523	if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	and 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	exactly , I need it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.524	so . Hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Could you post some other essentials of what people want , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.525		
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	You seem to have information on that , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I'd like to uh see some of it . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.526	No , it wasn't wasn't allo 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	No , it's not . No . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Not . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.527	it was possible , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.528	not allowed , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.529	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.530	So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	My computer crashed , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	so uh 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.531	I don't care . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	I lost my uh presentation , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.532	I haven't heard any complaints yet , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Oh , your computer . Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.533	so . Um 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	but 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	I have the uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Well , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	I have your PowerPoint presentation , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	I can get some inf information out of that . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	but I 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Let's see . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.534	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.535	the oh , they inc uh 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	and here is my 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.536	they include the new one . Or just for you . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Oh , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	where would we 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	here is my marketing report , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	maybe you ca you can look at uh that 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.537	Oh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.538	no , I didn't have that . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	and 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Where would we want the uh teletext button ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Ah yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Because we decided that it's n not that important . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	And one 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.539	All it tells just let's make make a new 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Do we put it somewhere over here ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.540	tick the new one . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.541	Um other side . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.542	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.543	let's increase it a little 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.544	because 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	And uh wha what people want , I've uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	I can draw out some ideas . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.545	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.546	draw us up some some designs of of possible 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I have another thing uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.547	just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.548	so the more less important 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Well , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	we have decided more or less the basic structure . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.549	More or less . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	I can put the other buttons in 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.550	Just play a little with this , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.551	put l 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.552	shift a little up or down 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.553	and we'll see what looks best . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	What uh what did you wanna say ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.554	Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Yeah . Um 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Maybe another idea uh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	not uh they want to 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Mm . Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.555	Yeah , so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.556	we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	No 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Mm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	It's 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	it's easy to learn 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yes , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	but it should cover all the functions , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	wi and uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	so possibly , just an idea that popped in 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.557	Well 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.558	what 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Um 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.559	we had function that what people do , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.560	so . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.561	People change channels , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.562	people they change the volume 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.563	and they they change channel , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.564	they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.565	That's the basic fu 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.566	that's what you do 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.567	I'm not sure who present that again , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.568	but those are the basic function that people use it for , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.569	so those should be very well represented . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	And The If 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	but we could go a step further , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.570	That's true , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.571	but that's what we stick under the menu button . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.572	Everything is 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.573	you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yes , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	but it 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	But that's the question , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Because we're making 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	is it ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Um 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.574	Yeah , but 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	We need to adjust to the technology . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.575	But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	I think so too . I think so too . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	True . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	No , I thi 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	If um 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	That's a bad bad com commercial 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.576	Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	for 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.577	Under forty . Yeah ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	That's true . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.578	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	because my computer crashed . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.579	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.580	The want to pay for 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.581	Oh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	i 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	and 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Do they realise how much that costs ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.582	Uh shall we ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	That's almost undoable . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.583	Younger , age sixteen and forty five . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Uh but 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.584	That's all here , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.585	here it says 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	No , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	that's that's . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.586	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.587	age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	If if they 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.588	Okay , so 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.589	we're not focusing on this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.590	Um All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.591	oh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.592	here . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.593	Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.594	Hmm , okay ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	So uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205		
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	we can 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.595	Speech recognition is quite 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	and uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.596	Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	I dunno . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.597	because if 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.598	apparently it's what people want , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	How much it will cost 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.599	it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Uh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	and 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.600	maybe it's not even that expensive . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.601	Or find a compromise , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.602	maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Uh I 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Um 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Well 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	I doubt it , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	but 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	But I really need finance information . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.603	Me too . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.604	I mean we all do . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	It will come uh 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	We all do . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.605	Right . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.606	I think it's something we should put into consideration . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.607	Apparently it's what people want , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.608	so . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.609	We should see if what it costs , if it's possible . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Uh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.610	Yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.611	we should do a little thing about design , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.612	because it looks boring really to me . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.613	Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Different colours maybe . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.614	so . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	And the design , it should differ . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	But all 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	This is Philips , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	huh ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Philips has this . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.615	I have no clue . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Well , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.616	I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	I had basically 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Uh . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Mm . Oh , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.617	I think it's a very 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	because I need to put all the electronics in it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.618	Sorry ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.619	Yeah ? 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	because I have to put all the electronics in it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.620	Okay . Mm-hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.621	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.622	but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.623	I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	No . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.624	Huh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	what kind of 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.625	even if 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.626	in the worst case we can even 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.627	Could you give me the pen back ? 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah , sure . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.628	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.629	let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.630	Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.632	I'll just make it a little bigger now . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.633	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.634	a transmitter here . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.635	Anyway . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.637	We could 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.638	let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.639	people want an L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.640	So then we should probably put it here . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275		
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.641	It doesn't have to be really big , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.642	but just just have to be has to be there . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.643	Think it's a good place , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.644	people don't 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.645	No ? 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.646	It's not that uh it's not the most important function , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Me too . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	It's j 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.647	it's just an extra thing , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Ah 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.648	it just 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.649	you press the buttons on top , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	but . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.650	because your finger is on top . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	uh because it's use it uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.651	How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	But nee the function of it . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	So you can use it maximum , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	because uh it's a lot it costs a lot . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	So 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.652	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.653	but why 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.654	I I'm not sure . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.655	Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Hmm . No . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.656	ri 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.657	I'm not sure wha 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.658	I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	M 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	I personally would prefer it on the top . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	I'm 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.659	You would prefer it 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.660	n 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.661	Okay . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Huh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.662	So we have three people saying it should be on top . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.663	Okay , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	But it 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.664	but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.665	Anyways . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	It's expensive to build it , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	so 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Mm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.666	Uh this looks a little 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	you must use the maximum of it . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	I'm still not convinced of the 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.667	About the L_C_D_s thing . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.668	Well 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.669	if it if it's 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.670	if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	They want it uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.671	because it's it's cool . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	but we need that information . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Huh . Uh . But uh 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	and that needs space . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	So I have to look if that's possible . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah , I know uh . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	But if we 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	So basically 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	can I 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.672	Uh we have green now uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	or do we put it on he 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Would we like to press it in the middle ? 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	In middle of it . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.673	Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	In the middle . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.674	Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.675	I think this is not good , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.676	but for 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.677	we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yes , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.678	because it 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	because it's basically the most important function . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.679	I think the channel button should be in the centre . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	It's the most import yeah . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.680	Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.681	Because it's uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Well , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	that would make them quite small . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.682	We're not sure about the size anyway , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	So maybe you'd put them here . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.683	just a general design . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.684	You can make it as big as you want . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.685	For example if you take uh 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yes , 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	Hmm . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.686	No , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.687	let's see . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.688	For example just 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	It is rechargeable , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	so we can stick with one instead of two . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.689	Yeah . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	. 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	That might be an option . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.690	I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.691	Yeah , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.692	but we have to see what the si what the size is . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	But it has to be a little bit heavier . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Okay . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.693	The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296		
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	No , 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	but the things behind it . space . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.694	Mm let's see . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Like a process uh . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Finish meeting now . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	It's on your computer . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.695	Finish meeting now . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.696	Okay , we will . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	So 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	would we like this 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.697	So either 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	or would we like the 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.698	We either we have to decide what what people want . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	I like this one more . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.699	Either this one , 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.700	this this could be the luxurious one . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.701	So we have channel buttons here . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.702	I'm just drawing something uh . Uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.703	I think this would this would look cool . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.704	You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Uh . 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.705	so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . 	
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Mm . 	
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Let's see what we have here . 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Or 	
TS3012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	And uh what about speech recognition uh 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.706	Well 	
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.707	you can just
