IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Very good . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	And as you already know I am Betty . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I am the project manager for today . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	well , the tools are , I think , we already 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	and we'll take it from there . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	No . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Here is what this thing should be . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay ? 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	All right . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	The same goes for the conceptual design , 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Detailed design , same thing basically . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Mm 'kay so 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Functional , conception and detailed . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I can't write with this thing . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Maybe we should redesign it . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	All right ? 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Then , tool training try out the white board , 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	participant can draw their favourite animal . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	You wanna go Eileen and 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Okay , I'll see what I can do . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Whether you without hanging yourself . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	See if I r 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	And remember you have to press so it works . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	So that it will record okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um uh um traditional kitty cat . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Fat , a fat cat . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I've a very fat cat . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53		
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	And it likes to sit like that . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And you're Francine , right ? 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yes , I'm Francina . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yes , sure . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Am I supposed to wipe off that or 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	In 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	No , no . No , that's okay . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	No , Okay . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I don't know , 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	we'll get to that later . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	What should I draw ? 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Snake . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I'm going to draw a snake . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	How does it look like ? 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Uh , okay . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Okay . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Here's the project finance 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	the market range unlimited meaning international 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Profit . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um is fifty mm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	to materials , cost , etcetera . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Oops . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yes . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	And um 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	ye any first ideas ? 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , I 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Small , right . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah , 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	those which we get here nowadays it's very long . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And um and it should have multi-purpose . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Audio player . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Oh . Okay . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yes , exactly 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Hmm . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Divides us 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . Exactly . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	At um twelve fifty Euros per 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Well . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	We certainly can try to 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	That's right . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah , of course . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	All the almost all the remotes 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah , 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yes , exactly . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	maybe ten 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I do yeah , colours 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Are different shapes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and al shapes also . Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yes . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Um so yeah shapes right , you know , 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yes . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah of course yeah . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yes . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	That is true , 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So some 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah , some beep or something like that , 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Or a b 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	so that we can go 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So if lost 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Should ha 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	A fluorescent signal , yeah . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	May not be beep . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay so 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yes . 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Okay . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah , probably 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	yeah , probably it's a 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	yeah , yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . 	
IS1009a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And uh 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So the light sensor would activate the signal . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	That's right . 	
IS1009a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	You know there would be 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	right you have to have some kind of sensor 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . 	
IS1009a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , 	
IS1009a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm-hmm .
