TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	So , now um , last time . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Can you uh push the button ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	One time please . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	So 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I'm still the secretary . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	One of your you two . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	I don't care . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Oh this , you mean ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Huh ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yes . The prototype . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yes , well uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	this is it . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	This is it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Well , thank you . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh , now 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	It's uh it's uh it's yellow . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	And uh , this is rubber . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	And and and this too . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	The 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	the sides . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yes . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	And the rest is hard plastic . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	We uh we had some uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And then it covers the these buttons 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	until here or something . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yes . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So , you can still operate uh all the things . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Because you don't always use the menu . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And then it can break . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And the buttons ? 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh , well uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Big . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Big buttons . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And everything is blue , except the power button . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And the mute . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Of uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	yeah , and the mute and the the other button . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Channel higher channel button . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	. 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Uh , yes . Yes , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yes . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	that's uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Very obvious . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Up is channel up . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Down is channel down . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	To the right is volume up . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	To the left is volume down .

TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Now , the finance . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Alright . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So , I'm gonna look . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Do we 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Do we change the 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	We have 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Sorry ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Do we change the the order ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Finance is um 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah it's 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	No , 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	first uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Sorry . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	That's uh um 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	That can be none . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	But I have uh a introduction how it works . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	So , it will come up . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Uh-oh . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um , yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Well , we uh uh , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	We can uh 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Well , it look like this . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	But we gonna uh do it here , they said . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay , yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um , well uh we have the Word document 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Criteria . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	You 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	So we open up that blank here . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Think I can 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	But um , if I can get a number in here . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Hmm . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	No , it's okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Well , uh we can't do that . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I'll get it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Oh , it's okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	The first uh on each item . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	What do you think ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Only the L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So , it 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Hmm . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	What uh not anoth uh , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I think technologically I'll give it an seven . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Si six six . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Sorry , six . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And you true or false . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Oh , true or false . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And true is one . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So , yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Sorry . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	You ? 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Three . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Me too . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	So it's a three . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	'Kay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um , well 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	It's a one . The first item . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So , okay the second item . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	It doesn't look like that . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So it's a 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	That's uh a six . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Five . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm , four . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yes , it's for the younger g group . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah , but it's it's 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So it's uh half half of the people . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So I think it's four . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So I mean , the colours are for young people , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	but 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So , I think it's four . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	older 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . Maybe . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Give it a four . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Four . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Four . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yep . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh , okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	We put the fashion in electronics . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	That's uh the motto of our company . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I um Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um , so I would give it a two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	But the rest of it is . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So , I think a two . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yes . Two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Two . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Uh , I say uh a five . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	It's not fashion , it's new . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	It must be a fashion . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	But it isn't . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	It 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	it will be fashion . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	It w If it's not a fashion 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	we can put it in it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So , it must be a fashion . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I think it's a five . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Uh 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Then make it th three . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yes , I'll think of that too . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	No . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'Kay . Three is okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Oh . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , agree ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I use my feet though . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Oh , we'll wait outside . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	A three . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	The next element um is the product looks good . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So , I would give this a five . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I give it a one . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	. 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yes , a one . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I like it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Well , I say three . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So , counting then is two and a half . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	We have to do our uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Say two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Two or three ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Okay , two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Two . Okay . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So , well we gonna do the next part . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Uh , yep . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Um , yeah , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	And in the end we calculate an average . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So , um that's why it's a negative in it . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	So , um uh did we uh do that ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	But you can you can go for that . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So , I would give this a two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	One . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	You ? 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	One . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Me too . One . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	One . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Um , but where where is the ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Next , six . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	It does not get lost easily . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Just a small thing . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	No , we did not . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , but uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Ah . Yellow . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I don't think so . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Looks like a pistol . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Not a not a normal shapes . So 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	No . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	It won't get lost . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	So 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Uh 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	It won't . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	A one ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah , o one . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay , a one . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	One . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Next . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Uh yeah , did we achieve that . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah me 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . Me too . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	That was our target . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yep . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Right . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	There's a fancy look-and-feel . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Uh , yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	I didn't uh say it in my presentation . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	But um , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	well does it have that ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I would say yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So um 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Well , let's also give this a two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	T 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I gave this a one because of the rubber . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	It feels soft . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It's Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah , f very fancy trendy . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yes , a one . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I say a two . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So I think s two is better . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Okay . Two . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Two is okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	And um , then the last one I could think of , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	. 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	uh it goes with the latest trends . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	No , it's new . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Innovation . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	but we didn't uh 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Oh . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	We'll go for a three . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	. 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Uh , the latest trends are soft things , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	you know , like uh I said in my presentation . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yes . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Something what also younger people want . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm , three . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Me too . Three . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	A three . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	So um , come back to the presentation now . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So , we find yourself there , 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	and now we have to calculate an average rating . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So , we will do that . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Twenty one . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	By nine . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Two . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . Um , uh okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Two . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yep . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Come on . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Uh , nah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Okay . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	So , it's good . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Thank you . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah , I think . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Oh . Nah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	How am I doing ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And I closed your slide-show . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Back to my uh 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Which one was the last for you ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Uh , dreaming . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yep . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Next please . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Next . Finance . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	So , now uh we have a product . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Very happy . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	But uh , is it cheap enough ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Um , so if uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I'll have a look . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	We have a battery . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	One battery . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Cheapest there is . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Okay , one battery . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Electronics . Advanced chip . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Expensive . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	it's the most advanced . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Chip-on-print . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	We have that one . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Well , it's the most advanced . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	We have the simple , regular and advanced . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Advanced . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	We have the adva advanced . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	'Kay , so uncurved or flat . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Nope . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Single curved or double curved ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	We have double curved . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	we have half rubber , half plastic . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm , yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	No titanium . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Special colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yes , yellow . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Uh , yellow . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Mm , yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Interface , 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	push-button . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So , we have the L_C_D_ 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	One . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	One . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	And it's not really a s 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Joystick uh thing . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	. 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah , it's this one . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Now , uh button supplement . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Special colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	We already 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	The buttons are regular colour . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm , yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	So , then uh then then then then then then 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Then 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	We're not gonna make it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Uh , no . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	It's too expensive . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Wh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	So , we have to change something . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	What what are the costs ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Fifteen Euros . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Fifteen . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah , 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	'Cause we can't lose the battery . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	We can't lose the advanced chip . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	We can't lose the double curve . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	We have rubber , special colour . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	. 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	We would have uh n 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	A special colour . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Oh , no , we 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	No , it's uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Sorry ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	For a remote control . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	What ? 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I've 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	For a remote control , I think it is . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Um , then we uh lose two Euros . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Then we have thirteen Euros . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Half a Euro too much . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Exactly the special colours . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And what if we use only one sort of um 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um just only plastic or only rubber ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	That's one Euro . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	One Euro discount . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So , I don't think that's good . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Mm 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	If 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yes . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Then it's only thirteen Euros . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	So uh yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . Then you have 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Or you have to cut this off . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Uh uh-uh . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Then it's not good anymore . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	No . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So , wait . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . I'll have a look . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	We 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	it's a normal colour , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	wh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	No one will see it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yellow rubber . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah , normal . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Normal colour , and the the joystick away , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	and put the button up , button down , right , left . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	And it's twelve Euros , I think . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	One minute , please . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Is it maximum . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Um 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , it's normal colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	No . Uh , no , no , no . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Or it's then a regular ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Oh , wait wait wait . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	wasn't it ? 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Oh yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .

TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , regular chip . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	But 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Is it a good design ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh , yeah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	And you don't have the L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	If uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	If we have the n no buttons 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm , yes . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	And then uh we move the the colour . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	What will that be ? 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Then it's okay . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Huh . No knew that . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Okay , so no joystick . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .

TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Twelve and a half Euros . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Then it's okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	So , we have to change that a little bit . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	And you cannot use the red and green button . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Because if you give them a s uh colour , 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	All the same uh 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	you have to pay point two Euros . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yes . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	But then the print on it will g um change it .

TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	About the 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Project . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	About the project . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	process . Went good . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Uh 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	We have a gun instead of a remote control . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Um 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh leadership . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257		
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So yeah that was clear . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Team-work okay . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	And uh no , 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	But , nah . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	New ideas found . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Nope . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	And you . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah , well the same . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	the the SMARTboard 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	and uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah , it uh 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Okay . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	I think um 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	and uh you would also see there . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	And with a normal mouse . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . 	
TS3010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	To tell their opinion . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Okay . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Well , what do I have to say . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	I think it was good . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Not too many discussions . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	No . 	
TS3010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	So , it's good for the speed . 	
TS3010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	No . 	
TS3010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yep .
