TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	But where ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	What's the name ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Uh uh uh 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	What's the name of it ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	It was about the working of the remote control . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	It's the technical function or the functional requirements . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Nope . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Not a of 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Wait . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	The working design . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	But I've saved it . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Working design . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	But now I don't know where it is . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Hmm . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Working design . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	What is this ?

TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	And I import this until 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	On the desktop . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Up . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	up .

TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	PowerPoint . Working design . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Yeah that's the empty one . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	And 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	I had one . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Presentation of working design . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Uh-huh . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Open it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Okay here it is . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Save as . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Uh it's 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Desktop . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Project . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Project . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Yeah . Okay . Well . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Save . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Very good . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	A little later but here it is . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	So 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	So okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	It's about the working of the remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	I just had an half an hour j to study it 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	and I don't get it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Make it . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Now have ten minutes to tell it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	I think it will be a few minutes and 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	First uh I will tell you something about the findings , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	what I discovered about the remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	The working bout it uh of it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and it's the top of the remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	With a little bit of science , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	uh you 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	I will show that uh in in a few minutes . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	And then uh what I'll think about it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	First , the findings . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	um because its uh not so expensive . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	And there are uh a lot of uh wires , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	uh which um connect the components in it , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	the battery , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	and there are um switches and things like that . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	There's a lot of small uh electronics . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Now 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	And here I have the top of the remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Uh here's some kind of chip . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Uh you have all on your remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	And uh the teletext uh button . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	And uh here's the battery . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	That's what I said , it's very difficult . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	And after that it will be sent to the infrared . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	And that will send it to your television . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	That's a short h uh how it works . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	but we all we all don't get it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	My preferences ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	It's uh it won't be uh 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	We shouldn't make it too big . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	A long-lasting battery . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Not other materials . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	That's I think it's easier . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	This is uh just uh 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Oh oh . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Two questions . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	The battery . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	You say one battery is cheaper . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Why ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Yeah but 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	when you use two , you can use it two times longer . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah but 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Okay so it's the size of the remote control . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Just 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Okay and the buttons . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Then this is an option . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	So 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	but then we won't use the 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah but I don't I think it 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	They are two different things though . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	We have to choose one . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	It has to work on o uh all televisions . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Mm . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah ? Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Hmm . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	And I just uh have one more idea . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Hmm . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	And also different things . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah . Good idea . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Will this will this add to the cost ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yes . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	And then you can buy the covers . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Yes 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	but you have to m uh be able to change it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	D does it make it more difficult to design ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	I think it will be a little more difficult , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	but not too much . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Not much . 'Kay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Just one . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	If it won't works then we'll get something else . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Yeah but there are also design cost . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	I don't think 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Maybe . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Would you change the cover ? 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	I wi I won't . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	But maybe I think trendy people 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	No . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	or like children where you can paint on it , 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	N yeah but 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	And the other people ? What do you think about it ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Yeah it's a good idea . But 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	If if it Yeah , I don't 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82		
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yes it is 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	but I don't think we have to do it . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	No . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Mm . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	You're the Project Manager . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Yes . That's it . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	That's clear . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Okay thank you . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So now the User Interface Designer . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Oh . That's me . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Uh 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Come on . . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Ah . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137		
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	No cords attached . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Uh well the same idea here . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Uh message to the television . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Uh 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	well these are two uh remotes , 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Or uh uh more functions on the remote . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Uh maybe more devices you can influence . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Yeah 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	well that's our dilemma . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Um any ideas about that ? 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Basic or multifunctional ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	We'll got back on that later . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Okay yeah . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Yeah well the that was just on my mind . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yes . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	'Kay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	'Kay , thank you . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Uh um m 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Um yeah okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	This bit too far . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139		
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	So 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	about um yeah what people think . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	And we looked at uh several um things . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Uh among them design , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	uh d d how d did they like the use of it , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Uh well what what will be our market . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Well our findings . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Uh well they also zap a lot . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	So uh zapping uh should be very easy . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	So a lot of unused buttons . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	There is more findings . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Uh on the buttons . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	And how much would they use them ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Uh not important they found the audio , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Then we have a few um graphs about the market . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	But uh they are not a very big group . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	And they won't like it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Well here we see the same . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	And old users not . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Uh the first are the younger , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	the age between sixteen and forty five . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	And um they are more critical on their money spending . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Uh the second group is the older group . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Aged between forty six and sixty five . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	They are less interested in uh new features . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	But uh they spend their money more easily . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	And the second group about forty percent . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	So the the first group is bigger . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	But less of them will buy it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Um well I uh 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	And um we can make special features . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Um well th uh that's my second point . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	It's about discussion we had earlier . Um 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Um well the design is very important . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	But they found most remote controls very ugly . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	So the design of our remote control is very important . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	as most users use it for that . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	That were my findings . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Okay thank you . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah . I have uh one question . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yes . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yes . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	No . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Do you think ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	No . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Like 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	No . No . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	So it's Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Uh-huh . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Just the L_C_D_ ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	So 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	But we'll come back on that . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Now 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Oh , go on . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	What d d d um 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Um 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Uh we go back on the decisions later . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Now we have a few new product requirements . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	First , teletext . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	So not necessary . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Next . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Only for the television . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Only the television . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	We look at the age group of forty plus . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Uh no , younger than forty . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Is a g big group , 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Fourth point . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Very important for the design . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	So you can see it on our site . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Next . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Um no . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	So like you said , we need the . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Maybe it's good to put it in a document . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Now we have to decide what controls do we need . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	So maybe you can tell us . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Sorry ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	The the requirements you just said , 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yes . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	maybe we should first have a discussion about that . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Yes , it's okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah but we don't use it . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	It's a new requirement . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	So , it's not my requirement . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	'Kay , we'll just have to do that . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	We have to do this . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Okay . Okay sorry . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	No discussion about it . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Then uh 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	No . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117		
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Unfortunately . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	So 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	what controls do we need ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Who first ? 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Well a power button ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Uh power . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Uh the well um I think separate channels . So 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Uh mm channel . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	But then both the the separate channels . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	So so uh zero to nine or something . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Channel 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Zero to nine . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Uh volume . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Volume . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Maybe it's easy to pick . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	What was w your one ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Techno 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Mine ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	It's the functional requirements . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	We had w 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	uh no no no no . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Where was that example of the 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Oh mine . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Johan . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	That was the the the the the 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Technical . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	technical 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Hallo . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	What do we need ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	On-off . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Zero to nine . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	To change to the next channel , just one button . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	To move up , move down . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Yeah that's the channel . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	D Yeah . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Do we make a menu ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Menu ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Uh yes 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	the n newer televisions ha do have menus . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Uh 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Uh 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	M Menu . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	I think um the only one or two numbers . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm yes . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	And 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Hello ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	That's ch 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126		
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Up-down for channel selection , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	and left-right uh for volume . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yes . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	And uh a menu uh button . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	and you can use the same buttons . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	'cause it it has to work on all televisions . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	So 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yes . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	But then we come to the costs . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	we need 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	N Yes . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	But if we have this 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	'Kay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	So now we don't have a lot of buttons . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Is this enough ? 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Mute . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Mute . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Maybe in the menu ? 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Um 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Mm . 	
TS3010b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yeah . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Maybe more ? 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186		
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	No . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Well . Then that's all . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	This will be the buttons . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	And 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	I think that's enough for the next phase . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	So we can go on to 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	But now we have only the buttons . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Yes . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	No 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	that's for the next phase . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Um 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Phase two is the conceptual design . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	So then we'll have the concepts . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Okay . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Okay . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	That's for the 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	So uh next point . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Now we have lunch-break . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	After that we have t thirty minutes for work . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	No . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Your individual action , you can find them in the email . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	So now it's time for lunch . 	
TS3010b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Okay . 	
TS3010b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Okay . Good idea . 	
TS3010b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Thanks for coming .
