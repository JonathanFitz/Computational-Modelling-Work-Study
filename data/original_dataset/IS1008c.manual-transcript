IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Uh welcome back after lunch , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	I hope uh you had a good lunch 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	together . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Okay and the agenda will be the opening 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	And finally in this meeting we have to decide 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	So we have forty minutes , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	I think it's uh little bit uh low , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	but I I hope we can finish it up 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	so I'll handle to the the functional team , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	to the Christine , okay , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	to discuss about uh the components concept . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Okay . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	I'm number two . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	You're number two . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	'Kay 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Components design , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	there we go . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	The next one . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Right here , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	is that little 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	that one , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	yes please . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Thank you . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	I'll take the mouse . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	So uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	you have to have microphone 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	but um 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	maybe you do have it a a way 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	it has to it has to hear the speaker 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	and um , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	but somewhere you have to put the microphone , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	um 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Um so the other w thing that we So . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and we contacted manufacturing for their input 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	so uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	this is the approach that we took during our um our research . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	so then we were thinking about um rubber , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	so um we still had titanium and and wood available , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	but uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	At least it's environmentally friendly . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	So , this is our finding . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	so we're we're currently uh proposing , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	And um then there was the regular which 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	and uh we liked th we 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	we found that it it includes this infrared sender , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	so uh we we uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	now jumping right to our personal preferences 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	So this is the findings of our research 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Do you have any problems with that ? 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Can you go back uh one slide ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	I'm not sure , how do I 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Oh , I know , let's see . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Thank you . Yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Let's go back up here . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yes , uh 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	What's the meaning of that ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Yeah , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	is it means it's on the yeah 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I don't know , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	but I'll find out more at our next meeting . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Okay , tha that would be great , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	so if you find out from the technology background , okay , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	so that would be good . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Sounds good . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Because um it gets brittle , cracks 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Um 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	We want 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Good ex Good expression . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Whic 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Wow , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Which 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	good expression . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Well after us . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Although I think 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	wouldn't you , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	I mean it chips , it if you drop it , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	uh it's I'm not su 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Actually , I'm ready to sell it . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	you're what ? 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	I'm ready to sell it . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	You think ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	No y no no no , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	but you can't just use 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Yeah , exactly , yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	but there are some very pretty woods out there . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Well I'm glad you 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	That's actually very innovative idea . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Okay , good . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	The stain . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	what about yo you ? 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Um , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	In turns of wow . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Y yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Luckily Ed was not . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Wood ? 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Yeah , for example . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	So , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	but 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	so , and chew 'em up . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	And chew 'em up . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Sure . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Oh , I'm sorry . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	S you're 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	You are in participant three . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	One point three , yeah 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Uh , yeah . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	This one ? 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	I think so , yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Yeah , that's the one . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	So , it's a very short presentation , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	um , which basically shows , sort of 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Right , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	my hand is uh different size than yours for example . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	And also um you had issues with the batteries running out , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Mm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Have I forgotten anything ? 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	I don't think so . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	No . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	A hinge . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Be like a copper hinge or you know . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Mm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So , that's pretty much all I had to say , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Mm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	but more or less I think it should go along those lines . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	So what's your , uh , the comments or uh s 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Simple design . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	It's what consumers want . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Okay 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Problem is obviously gonna be cost . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Okay , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	I also have a f very simple presentation , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	I also have uh copied a different type of remote . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	If you can find me , where I'm at . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	There should only be one in here . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	trend watch . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Sure . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	It's being modified . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	They're stealing our product . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	'cause uh trends change very very quickly . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	No , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	f go to findings . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	No , no . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	No no , no no . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	'Cause I had another comment there . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Looking for next generation of innovation , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	we have to have something completely different . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Okay ? 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	The first one , I see that they put in a display . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Right . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Okay 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	, we might've 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Oh yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	To t an 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	How hard they squeeze ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Yes 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Resistance resistance , right . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	you'd know what kind of wood to get . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	The sales , yeah . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	The 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	I hope so . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	and from 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Although , what it was it uh 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Right , mm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	and then they sold millions , millions . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	And that took off , yeah , yeah . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	So . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Cost of living is low . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	yes , yes , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	countries like India or China or Malaysia , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	So 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Good , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah , yeah , so 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Mm yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160	and to where 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Yes . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	So 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah , so 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Yeah 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	We're here to design , come up with a nice product . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yes uh , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	So , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	I think it depends , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	I mean I think it's a good idea , 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	very specifically what it would be used for , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	What do you think Ed ? 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Do you 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	um , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	No . No 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	no p spec 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Okay . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Sorry about that . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Um , no that's no problem . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Yes . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	I will market it . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Once we get a price on it then we can market it . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180	So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.181	and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.182	and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	A customisable and 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137		
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.184		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Uh I don't think so , no , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	I don't think so . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	I think they could be rubber like they are now , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yes . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yes . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	so you have that tactile experience of 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Don't looks nice uh . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah , so uh 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Okay . So 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Okay . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Okay ? 	
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Sure . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105		
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	So um 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.192	are we done with this meeting ? 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106		
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah , I hope , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	if 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Then they can show you how it looks like , 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	and then we can uh submit to the 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	I will submit to the management . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Okay ? 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . 	
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188		
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.193	And a marketing strategy . 	
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . 	
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	And marketing strategy , thank you .
