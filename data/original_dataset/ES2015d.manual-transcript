ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Here we go . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Alright , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	the agenda for thi 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	oh . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Alright . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	And um evaluate the product , as a group . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And um 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So first we'll have the prototype presentation . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	I just got a few slides , so show them . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Alright . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Thank you . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Um 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Do you want to present it ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	This is what we came up with . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah , here we are . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	It's a pretty simple design . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	It's um based on a mango ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	And we 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mango shape . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	On ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	A mango . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	And we have the company logo here 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	and this will be the infrared here 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	The L_E_D_ . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Oh . Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I'm sorry . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	What was the 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	where's the L_E_D_ ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Oops . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Oh . Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	And then the other one is the power . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	And uh we just have a simple design . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	We wanted it all to be 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So it's palm-held . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	accessible from your thumb 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	yeah palm-held 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	and all the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	buttons are accessible from your thumb . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Notice you have a number ten button . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	So you don't have to 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Oh that was a mistake , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	wasn't it ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Right no , that's a zero . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	You just need the nought . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Take that one off . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Sorry . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I was in charge of the numbers . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	No problem . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Ah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So one plus one would be eleven , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	You can go one , three or something . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	or 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Oh . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	You press that first and then you go one three 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	You press a plus button ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Oh okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I've never heard of that kind before . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	because if you 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	there's no e 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So the plus and then 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Oh . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	I 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	But 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	No no , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	th all 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	that's why we have all these numbers . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	These numbers um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	these numbers all work independently up to nine . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Oh no . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah I know , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Sixty . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	You p 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Oh . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	No you press the plus first . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I I well it doesn't 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Oh . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	we haven't really s 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	but she says plus press which 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Well I don't mind , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	we can further define that . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	what do you think is simpler ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I th 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	It's a 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	But I was just wondering 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	But I suppose it's not as snappy . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Oops . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Where you can have it 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	it's like a five second input time . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	If you don't put it 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So as long as you hit them dada 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	that 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	it should be fine . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Um 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Was there 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	so on the top there is volume and 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And channel , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	A channel . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Channel up volume up . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Okay cool . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	C_ and V_ . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Just so we can flick 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Right , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	where um where's the power button ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It's the bigger R_ . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It's the R_ . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Oh okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So it's just like . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	We deci 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Oh okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Uh e ergonomics are all considered . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	But yeah 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	, no I mean it's a different movement 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	so yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	The spon yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	and it just feels feels different . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Bit of a stress ball feel . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Would you like to feel it yourselves ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yes . I would . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	How it fits in the palm of your hand ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	My goodness . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Thanks . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	There you go . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And you ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yes 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Genevieve ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	. Oh it's nice . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Oh I think I killed the five . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	I did . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	I killed the four . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	And something hmm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Oh god . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	O 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Oh it smells good . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Of Play Doh yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Or the combination . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Oh right . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	'Cause it'd be quite subtle and 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	It looks more 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Think like vanilla and banana would . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Kinda Christmas , you know . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	yeah , seasonal . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Cool . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . Um yeah 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	and that's about it . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Alright , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	thank you very much . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Good work everyone . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Bravo 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Alright . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	So , I have 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	something I'm going to 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	You want the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oh wait a minute . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Do you need to do a presentation first ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I don't know what order it goes in . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I'm gonna check that out for a second . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	I have one . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm go 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	What time is it anyw 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Oh yeah 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	sorry 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	you're right . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Evaluation cri Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Evaluation criteria is next in line . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	That's me . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Hello . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Oh there we go . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Come on my computer . Come on . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Sorry 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	my computer's giving me technical difficulties . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Just press um function eight again . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Should I press it again ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Last time I did that it sh 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . You're right . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And then again I think . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	One more time . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Oh . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Still not there . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay now I think for this one I could 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Okay so question number one . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Does the remote 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	whoops . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Sorry . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Oh I'm not gonna be able 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I can't change it 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	I'll write down our scores up on the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Ooh . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay so number one . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Feel I think . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	We've been quite successful with the rubber coating 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	and 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	The look is a little bit more playful . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Well 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	but it's definitely different . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	It's not your traditional 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Oh definitely different yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I think the colour has a lot to do with it . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Oh you were only given red and black ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	red , black and yellow , and orange . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Oh okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah so 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	not very sleek 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	A metallic-y finish we were thinking . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Well I know know it's for rubber . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Polished . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I kinda I like the potato look . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	We we were we were thinking about 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	It's mango . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	It's very different . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It's what ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	It's mango . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Oh sorry 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	the mango the mango look . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Potato's fine . Potato's fine . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah . Totally . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	It's really adaptable . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So I myself would say a one or a two . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I would say two . Personally . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I w I'd say two I think . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	It's a two ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	For the 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	and p 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Fanciness . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	fancy 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	One being true . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	So 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I uh two , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Two . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	three . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Okay , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and the use of the rubber . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	For the anti-R_S_I_ . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Isn't 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Mm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	there's no L_C_D_ control , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	In some aspects it is , like we said . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	I'd say maybe three . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I'll go for three as well . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	And I think I mean it it's tough to say 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	because we were 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . Though it was our specification . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah we want it simple . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	So I mean I 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	we'll put three , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	but I think we actually reached our goal . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	We didn't want it any more than that . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay question number three . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Uh , will it be easy to use ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I think so . Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah very . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . S 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I think one for that . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I think it's 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . One . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	you can't really get confused with that . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	No . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Th 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	The plus number thing . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah that's the only thing yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	But once that's figured out , it should be fine . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah and perhaps the turning on 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	but 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Number four . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Is this a good-looking remote ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	It's definitely 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Again I think the colour comes into this . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I think that the logo could be smaller . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And maybe not such a prominent way . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	But the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Not in 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Whoops . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Oh it just had to be on there I guess . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Should just not touch it . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Don't worry . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	This time it's the three I killed . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Or 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I suppose I've got quite big hands . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Well 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	But you know what I've just thought of there now . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	What 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	where's it gonna sit in your living room ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	and then the rest is like 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	round . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Oh . That's true . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	It would still be comfortable I think . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	We c we could handle it I think . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	so you wouldn't loo 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	like if it's flat here , so it sits up . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Like that . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Oh that would be nice . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Ah it'd fall over all the time though . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	It'd be annoying . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Uh yeah , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	it's less um , what's th ha . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	I g 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	If it's weighted maybe . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	'Kay we're done designing . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Details , details . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Come on . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Three . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I think maybe a two . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	but 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	but definitely in another colour , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I'm not happy with those colours . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay , so should we say two for that ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Sure . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Uh , question number five . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	What's um 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	We have to market it . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	And the kinetic energy part . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	ooh no . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Shake it and the buttons fall off . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Durable . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	But you know , those'll be firmly on . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Don't shake 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Oh no the plus . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	You're 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	use the zero . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Make a new one . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	But you're our Marketing Expert . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	but 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I know I am , aren't I ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	I think they're about ten po ten pound , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	aren't they ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	About ten pounds . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	But you don't have to buy batteries . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Fifteen ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So in the long term this can actually save you money . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm , yeah , that's true . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Oh . Exactly . Exactly . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	So we'll market it that way too . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . Good point . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	I would give it a two still though . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Okay number six . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Can someone read it out ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Or 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Mm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Um yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	So that was mainly that the statistics 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I think it does very well . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Oh yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Because 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	we said 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	yeah , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	The zap 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	And it's just you won't have to think about it . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	You don't have to look down to find them . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	They're clearly there , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	easy to use . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Simple . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	I guess the I think the key word there is average , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Uh 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	But they're not you and I really . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Okay so one ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Number seven . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	C Heather could you push it down ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Now is there the 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	We have the alarm system . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	is the alarm system still was it implemented ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	the bu 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	It 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	l lights on and , or flash as well . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	It'll be again in the marketing . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	The light it will . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Or or was it gonna make a noise ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	But 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	But when the alarm's not 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	yeah 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	But both 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	. If you 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	You press the button it makes a noise 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	It turns into a duck and starts quacking . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	right ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	You could s 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Oh , that would be brilliant . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Here I am . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I'd be tempted to 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Um 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	It would have to be in the market 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	I though w it was gonna make a noise . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . Alarm , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	but you still couldn't see it . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	We 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	But yeah , it'll be there . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	So we can we could say that 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Oh okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Whoo . Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Sorry . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	We can give it a one , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah , totally . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay . Um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Sorry Heather . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	That wasn't very clear . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	No problem , mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Question number eight . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	So it has to be 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Totally . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	yeah , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	So the plu the plus 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	The plus thing needs to be worked on . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	won't it ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	I think 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Well 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Do 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	so it's just like channel six , six , enter . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Mm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	I don't know why . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	You could just press six enter , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Oh okay . Right . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	And or sixty six enter , y 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	or one two enter . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	And then like twelve , enter . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Alright , aye . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . Good 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Um , okay so we can 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	I'd say w yeah one . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	we'll say yes it's uh one ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Ooh . Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Question number nine . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Oh . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	which was repeated strain injury ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Injury . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Um , which affected over a quarter of users . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Hmm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	S 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	I think so . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	It's like right in the 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	But if you're zapping 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Your thumb might get a little bit uh 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	I don't think it will f 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	the biology . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	But it is soft . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	It's soft , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	And that's kind of what the um 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	and 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Mm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	And people could 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	so maybe it is but 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	I don't know what other options there are . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	I think we're getting 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	that's true . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Could 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Mm . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	So , one or two do you think ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	I I'd say t 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	I think 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	yeah , I think too . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	two . Yeah 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Two okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Okay number ten . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yes we did . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	N We we can't really do that 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Is the yellow 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	It won't stand out . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	It sounds like the colour's something that we 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Gray , yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	So it could be grey on the banana one . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah , could be grey . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	depending on the 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah that's right , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	we didn't even rea 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Mm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	I think this is the 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Perhaps a metallic 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Mm , yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	or or 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	No ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	That isn't rubber . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	And the buttons in the middle . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Okay 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	So , do you think that's more of a three then ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Three , four ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Four I think . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Four ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Well I don't 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	what do what 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Well we have good reasons for it , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Hum . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	so we but we can still put a 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	a four ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Okay . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Okay , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	and final question . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	I would say so . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Following that briefing we did . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	But maybe more like two 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	With the with the colours . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	I think I missed a few 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	they are ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	So you can have banana and kiwi and 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	like maybe it'll become more 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	It is . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	I think 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	w yeah , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	I think one . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Well we haven't got a big banana but 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Oh yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Be like 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	No . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	No . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Maybe if it was scented . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Oh that would be class . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Oh yeah . There we go . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	That would be great . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah we have money for that . Um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Um 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yes we do . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	A two for fashion ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Oh . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	I would say two . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah . Two . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	It's 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	is 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	One point nine or something ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	It's 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	I don't know these things . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Between one and two . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Um , between one and two . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Between 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	okay . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	So that's pretty fantastic . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Close to two . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Um . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232	I got 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Alright . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Does that seem right then ?

ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Oh . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Production costs .

ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	I dunno . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Or 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	okay .

ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Um , there we go . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Okay here we go . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So um if you can look up at the screen , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	um the large screen , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Oh right . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Um we're using a regular chip .

ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	double-curved yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	That's another three . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	We're already at five . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Um , we're using plastic and rubber , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	so 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Good thing plastic is free , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	we're at eight . Um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	What about a special colour ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	S 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Are we using that ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	I guess we should do it just for one kind . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	right ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	So we can 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	And a special material . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	And a special material .

ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	That's good . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Awesome . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	And back to our PowerPoint . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	So we've 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	'Kay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yes we are . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	So we need to do a product evaluation , again , 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	which is probably um 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.292	I dunno . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	A different extension of a 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Of the actual project rather than the product ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	A project ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Is is 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Alright so um 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	I think we were pushed . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Pushed for creativity ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	The ma 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Or materials . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	So I think we could've done with a bit more time . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Ye Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	So it'd be like need more time and materials . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	But you were allowed m creativity ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Yeah 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	and the conceptual and functional . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Well we were just limited by resources really 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	When we can down to it . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Right . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	So that did limit 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Creativity . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	creativity . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Right 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Just resources . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Okay 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	But yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	The fruit and veg idea . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Great . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Leadership ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Yeah we did . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	We've , uh 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	seeing as we've come out with what we intended . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	A pro um a product within the budget . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	I think that's a sign of good leadership 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	and also our personal coach helped us along the way , 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	so you know 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	And the timing was good . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	I think it's been fine . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . Good timing . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Oop 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Okay . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	And project manager of course . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Teamwork ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	I think we worked great as a team . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Yeah ? 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Was good teamwork . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	I think we are well-suited to our roles . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Alright how were our means ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Um 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	We needed more Play Doh colours . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317		
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Yeah and more Play Doh , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	'cause that was all the red we had . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.320		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Oh really ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Okay . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.323	But ever everything else was satisfactory ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Is that good 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	The computer programmes are good . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	The 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	It could be really straightforward for the computer . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	I don't think there was anything 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.325		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326		
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327		
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Yeah ? 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Mm . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.327		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	They'll probably still be there . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Uh me too . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.328	New ideas found . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.329	I don't really know what that means . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274		
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Um 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	like the n um 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Yeah . Through discussion . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	yeah . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Just about each different . Got new ideas from each other . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	I'm not sure , new ideas found . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Hmm ? 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	which was cool . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	yeah , worked well . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	And we were a able to modify each other's ideas 	
ES2015d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	to fit in with our areas of expertise .

ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280	If if it if it 	
ES2015d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	I dunno if we counted that in the costs . 	
ES2015d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281	If it can be afforded . 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Okay ? 	
ES2015d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide .
