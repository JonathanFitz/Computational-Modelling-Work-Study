ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	is , um , um , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	So this is a television remote control ? 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yes , it's a television remote control . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Right . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So , alright . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um , yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Same with conceptual design and detailed design . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So , um , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	making sure that it , it's usable , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	that as a , um 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	and that it's , it's feasible to create , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um , tool training . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Is , is everyone , um 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Okay . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah .

ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Um , one of them is our whiteboard . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So , um , I , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	I'm assuming that we should do that now . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8

ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Do you have elk where you come from ?

ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	cows . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	That's a great elk . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Uh-oh , we have a good artist . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	That is really good . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Thanks . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I'm quite 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	This is my 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Oh , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	very shapely . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Okay . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Brilliant . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	That's a sketching of my my elk , 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	that um , that um 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	and it uh 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	But it can really overcome harsh terrain , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	and uh 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Very nice . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Right . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Right , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I'm gonna take minutes 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay , I'll go next . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I am a big animal lover . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Oh . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Oh . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	but never mind . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Bit more cartoon style . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	But I like cats because they're so independent , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	They know what they want . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Basically , that's why I like cats . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Very good . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Great . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I'll rub that out . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	There you go . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	I think my favourite animal would be a dog , 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	but I'm not really sure how to draw one . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Ooh . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I forget her name . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	right 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Tara 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	or Tara . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	It's a cartoon dog I think . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	A s I don't ev 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Oh , oh well . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It's a scary cartoon dog . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	That This , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	that does not look like a dog . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	We can pretend . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	It looks kinda like a person . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I'm sorry . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	That's Pinocchio . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	How do you draw a dog ? 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	I suppose it has a lon 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Oh my god . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Right . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yous know what it's supposed to be . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	It's a dog . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	. Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	and they're just such friendly animals . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	And , like they're more of a companion than cats . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I've nothing against cats . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah , that's true . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	that don't look like that . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Alrighty . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	I feel like a robot . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . Um , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	well I guess I had the most time to think about it . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I'm going to draw a butterfly , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	At first I thought it was a dead leaf . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	And then it landed on the wall next to me . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And then it kinda 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	there was a green , I think it was a green ring , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	and there was like red going out like this . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	It's kinda like a peacock . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , it kinda was actually , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	'cause it was 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So I thought that was pretty cool . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I wish I'd had my camera . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	There you go . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Very nice . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Great . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh , what do we 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Oh . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yes I do . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yea 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Right . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Um , and make it for an international market . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Things like that , depending on which country you are . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Another thing for the design team to think about . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay , 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Twelve fifty . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I'm bad at math . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	'Kay . Um , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	so now that , um , that is underway , um 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	it is discussion time . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	It's always , where is the remote control ? 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So maybe if you could have some kind of 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I dunno , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	some kind of alarm . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	You can press a button on your wall , signal , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	'cause it always gets lost . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Do yous not find that , um , like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah , that you don't use half of them . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143		
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah , I don't know what they do . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	that's , that's 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	That's useful . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah , it is . Yeah . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Alright . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Any ideas will do that you have at this point . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Could be shaped like a conch , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Mm . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	you know . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Can hold it . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	A novelty . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Be like a shell-shaped remote . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Like , I've seen phones like a 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Okay . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable 	
ES2015a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	. 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So , hmm . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Right . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay we have five minutes left . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So , just to cover 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	We have one more thing . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Or not present but bring to the meeting . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Interface ? 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Industrial Designer . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Industrial Designer . 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Oh , industrial . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	That's me . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	I have to remember these things . Um . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	You'll be beginning your , your working design . 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Um , maybe how this can be achieved , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag 	
ES2015a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Marketing Expert . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Marketing Expert . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	And I'll see you in half an hour , 	
ES2015a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	okay ? 	
ES2015a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Okay .
