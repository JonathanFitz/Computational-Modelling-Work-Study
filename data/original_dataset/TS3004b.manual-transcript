TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Okay , so 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	let's have a look s at this one . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Okay , so 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	No , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	that's I uh s 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	I just got a email from the from the personal coach 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	So 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	have you changed that part ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Um so yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	It's it's still the same . Um 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	All these points uh we have to look at . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	You all know them . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	But uh there's another point . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	So they're old and not younger people . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	So we have to look at that as well . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Uh so So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	yeah , that's it , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	so just you can do your presentation 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	for uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Which one first ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Oh it doesn't matter , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	just start with the 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Mm . Uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Functional requirements , yeah 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay . Well 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	my name is Jens Damman , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	but we're in a group , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and I I will start it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Wait . Um 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I've used a marketing report on uh the site . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Uh I think you've uh read it too . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	I I didn't read i read it , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	so 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	it's not for me , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	You didn't read it ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I didn't get it uh anyway . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	No , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	I didn don't thing we got it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Oh okay , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	It's only for you . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	I I was the only one who get it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Yes . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Okay 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	So 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	I think uh uh that's a lot , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	so we have to make a beautiful remote control . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Well 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	okay , that's uh normal . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	But that's one of our requirements . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	The last point is quite an interesting 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Yes , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Um Martijn alr already said it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	if we 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	but 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	I don't think it's uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	we should have the ten percent on the on the top , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	reachable . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	then you're you're 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	That that's a good one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Um uh page two . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Uh you must find it uh quickly . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Okay , yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	we can uh combine that . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	But it's uh a tough one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	I don't We we haven't 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	last page . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96		
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	We didn't uh think about that already . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	We already thought about that . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	And 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	but they're more critical . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And older people uh want to spend uh more money . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	because they're in their old uh thinking way . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	People . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	because 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	It's too 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um then 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	I have my personal uh preference . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	that's not very good , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I had a question about . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	But it's already out of the question , this . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Um my point is , well , I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	But it's the exercise . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Because it's too expensive . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah , only only for television uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah , probably . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	And we only make it for television , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	but good usability , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	so you can use it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	I told about the home station . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Uh it must be simple , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	And I I found a motto . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	And we put the fashion in electronics . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	We we have to make a a new product . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	We have to be um Yeah . One of a kind , I think . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So it has to look uh uh uh unique , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Unique . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	but 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yeah , I reckon 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	But old people are not looking for that . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh I think mm 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Not really . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	to k to keep it simple when you 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	But uh we also have to stand out , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Sorry 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I thought about it , yes . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	But we have to make sure that we're better usability , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and stand out by just looks of it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	So make it just a different colour or different shape , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah . Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	so 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	this was uh my presentation . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Thanks . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	I don't 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Paul , you can do the next one if you want . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	You can ask some questions or something . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Yeah well Uh . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	There it is . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	isn't it ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Technical functions design . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Okay , well , so 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	we have s mm uh broad audience . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Isn't that isn't true anymore . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	But um we have elderly people , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	so we need to keep it simple . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Not too full , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	I have it on the next page . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Um so 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	the options that we put on there should be easy to use , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	and 'cause you have more room then , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and for elderly people big buttons . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Uh an icon on it or text on it , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	so it's very clear what that buttons does . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	to find out . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	But there is already in a one done . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	And I found an uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Could I think of favourites ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I always look up the same um pages on text 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and always have to click the number . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	and you get on your 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	So you might as well remember the number . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Or not ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	No y 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	but not sure . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Well 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	It's a good idea , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	it's 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	It was just a thought . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	but 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I'm , I u 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Well uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	switch to channel six . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yeah ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	So uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	button six says says six . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Just numbers . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	That can be in the in the 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Yeah okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	if you said a favourite 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	but isn't it hard to remember ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Like favourite one and 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Uh mayb for me it's 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	i 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Never ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	sh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Never . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	No , neither do I . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Oh . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Oh are you ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	And 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Okay now , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	m maybe not . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	If I don't do it , maybe old people 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	No , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	maybe elderly people uh . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Right . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	They don't like new features . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So maybe not . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Um well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	play , pause . I dunno if that's usable 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	It's not , it's still not It's not anymore n uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	when 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Not anymore for T_V_ . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Right , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	on off . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I dunno , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Um 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Just on the front as well . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	No , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	that's the only th the only thing you need . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Is 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Uh uh the p uh next and previous . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Previous I know , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	but next channel ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	I don't thi 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Forward . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Li like a web browser , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Six seven eight or five . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	so 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Oh , okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Just very simple . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Like a web browser back button . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Um I dunno . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Uh Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	I don't have Uh I did 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	I know what it is , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	but I think it's all too difficult for old people . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	No . Uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I don't think you use that . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Y only when you want to go to 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Normally you can press one , zero or 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	So you have that uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	A ten plus 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	or 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , the ten plus button . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	To just keep it simple and standard uh features . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Maybe the elderly people 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Uh yeah mayb 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	It gets some seconds . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	But you can have a button that says um 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	two two st two stripes . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Oh okay . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	it's it's no it's not a 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	but that's th mm 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	It's what Paul says . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	But do we still need a two level remote control ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Because if we only have that l only f 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	It's only for television now . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	So I I don't think so . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	No . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	No . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Uh I just thought of another one . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	So you also need a menu button . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	And then uh navigation uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	so you have 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	four arrows . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Because you n almost never use menu button . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah , okay , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	but um 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	You'll also have to use a mute button 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	to to 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah , a mute button . Yes . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Maybe , not 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Don't think so . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	I don't know where where you have to put it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah well , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	And later we can d uh do the design . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Okay , uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	now my personal preferences . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Uh using the standards , basic 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Um I dunno . Different colours um 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	or 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Maybe we can give it out in different colours . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	You can choose blue or yellow 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	It's like a iMac or something . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	or 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Just to make it 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	why not ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Or Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	But it looks cheap as well , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	because it's a small thing . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	It's only twenty five Euros . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	It looks very cheap if you make it 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Well , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Oh , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	you just 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	I dunno what happened . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Oh . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Who ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	They they're uh designed very well . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Just 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	But uh well , I think that's a good example . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Okay , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	we hurry up a bit , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	because otherwise we won't make it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Okay , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	sorry . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Is it fin 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Well uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Are you finished ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah , I I'm finished . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	I think we discussed everything . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Okay . Well , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	the working design . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um Basically 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	but uh I could figure it out . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Um basically what happens is you press a button , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	So 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	like you press a one , that circuit is closed 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	and uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	to uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	That's un uh invisible to the human eye . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	However it has also an uh a visible uh diode 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	that's uh blinking red if you look in it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And that's uh another diode , I believe . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Because infrared is not visible . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	So 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	that's er uh do two different things 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	but 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . I I think so . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	j Is 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	it's I think it's usable . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	that's active . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Or just a green one , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Maybe uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	I I think it's in the case that it's active . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	It's not uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah , when you press it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	But if you 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	So 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	I it's it's just uh the the 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Two ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Red's l shows up like something's wrong , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	and green is like it's okay , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	you press the button . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Mm . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Maybe depends on uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Ma on on most 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	on most uh uh remote controls it's red . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yes . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Okay , we make it red . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	But maybe 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I know . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	we don't have to make it red . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Maybe integrate it in the design as well . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	You have to 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Uh that's cool . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Uh Oh , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Empty . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191		
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	No , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	we have a recharger in it , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Oh . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	so 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Uh maybe . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	If we can still make that then 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	but it doesn't have to be red . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	It's just to indicate something's on . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	That it's working . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	That it's not not the batteries are low . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	But it's cool if it was green . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	It's it's not very important , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Green or red or whatever , it is cool . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	so yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Just to indicate it's working . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	So mm 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	We have to really understand what patterns are used , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	so we can uh o On the 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Otherwise it won't work . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	we have to uh make buttons for that as well , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	to make it uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	No . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	I I uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	The chip um uh is producing the pattern . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	An automatically search function for each television , or something . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	That are working . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	or 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	It wasn't explained there . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Well , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Uh I kno 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	I I use a universal uh remote control , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	And you have to put in a number , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	so it works on your T_V_ . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Oh , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I have a modern one . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209		
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125		
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	and the LED began to blink blink blink . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	And then you know , oh it it's the right one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	And you can stop it , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	and then it's okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Ah okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	So you don't have to search for your television or your code . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	It uh search uh the pattern for itself . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Okay , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	so we use that . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	So 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	it uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yes . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Because you have to 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yep . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	I just say 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Can you s just say it again , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	because I was just looking 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Uh okay . Well uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	There's just a short 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	y you have this chip . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	So uh basically 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	And uh by d uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Changing the signal . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	And um 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	so 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	And then he saves that setting 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	and then um it's working . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Yeah , that's the right uh option . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Okay . Well uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	the components . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164		
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	that's a bit technical , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	and I hadn't I w 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I was a little short on time . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Um but I think I understand it . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Um that's connecting to all the components . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217		
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Because it has to be fed with energy . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Okay . Uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	So basically 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	when you press a button , a switch get closed . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Um that's connecting to a chip . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	So the chip knows what button you pressed . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	I didn didn't put the description by this one . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165		
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	and this is a LED too . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	But this one is producing infrared light 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	that's invisible . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	And this one is producing normal light . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	To flash up your 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	But one you can't see 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	and one indicates that you use a button . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	presu 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Basically 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	if the battery is low , it won't work . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	and 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	So you see green if you push that button . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Huh , that's a good idea . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	No , y Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	And it's you also know which button you p 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	But it 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Everywhere in the r 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	You got still one LED . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	No I don't think so , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	but 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	i it it will look different , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	and I think we need to find something else . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	That looks different , yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Hmm . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	and our uh motto also is 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	but mm like when you push it 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	then then won't Then you won't see it . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	n n 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	You have your finger over the button . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	So you can see 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	It must be around it then . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	then 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Not not not not here , but here . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	or 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah . There . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Maybe uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226		
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah , we're thinking about it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	If you push 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	It lights up . Everything lights up . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	everything lights up . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	That's a good idea . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Why ain't that on a remote control ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	It's f 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	No , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	But if we use a battery station , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	which I think we will use 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	I uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah . We'll have enough power 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	to 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Everything agre 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Everyone agrees with that , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	or 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yep . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Maybe what Paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	and then you 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	And also it's 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	But you have to make a sound device in it then . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah , there must be sound in it . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Hmm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	But 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	it shouldn't take much 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	B 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Because it's i it has to be 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Mm uh , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Uh I th 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Bec 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Twelve and a half , okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	But but we only have to make it for television , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	and um we must have something special . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	So 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	But we lose about ninety percent of those options . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	So I think you can uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Uh . We have to give our customers some extras . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	I think we will save money with that . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Are you almost finished 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	or just 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Because I was short on time . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Okay . Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	No worry . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	But um 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	I just want to talk some about some more . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	So maybe you have to 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	this 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Oh , sorry . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Wh what's that ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	So uh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Oh , sorry . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	We have some new uh project requirements . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	We have to have a look what they are . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	They're still in um 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	I'm not sure . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I don't think so , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	No , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	No . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	but 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	It's only one button . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	So I don't think it is 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Uh . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Hmm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	We definitely should use it . Um 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	that's uh what I told you . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	The remote control should only be used for a television . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	that's maybe easier . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Oh 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	no , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	sorry . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Oh , this is a problem . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Oh sorry about that . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	So it should be flashy or just more interesting . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Oh . Mm . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Okay , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	that's It changes things . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	I'm sorry about that . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	I just I just didn't read it well . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202		
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	does it make some decision about that ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Changes . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252		
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Um 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	That kinda changes the whole situation . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Well yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	then we have to make some nice features . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	That still stays . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	That's important I think 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	and 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Oh . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Mm ah 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	So 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I I don't y you'll use it often , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	because you can see on the television wh what channel you 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Okay . No , it's not 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	No . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	So , but uh Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	What other features can we put in ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	And uh then the usability is not that required , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	About you said one and the television turns on one . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Is that reachable maybe ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	That's very That's fancy . That's cool . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	I didn't read 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	It's very fashion . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I didn't read any 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Twelve and you've got twelve . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	b 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Yeah . Yeah okay . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Mm . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	I I know . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Mm . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	That should be cool . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	If it's possible , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	But 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	I don't know . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	I didn't read it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	I don't think it's very expensive actually . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Mm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Why should it ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Uh if i if i 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah , I think it's 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	You only have a microphone in it . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	I didn't have information about that . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	But it has to work . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Nah , maybe 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Ah 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	that's a problem , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	but 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	And and uh w Yeah ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Uh only in English . Only in English I think . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	What 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	But uh I dunno how that works then . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Uh does your uh 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	it's probably my job to figure that out , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	but 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	No , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	uh one to have in channel one ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	that 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	then th we have to think about that . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	But do do we do it ? 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	It's more if we if we do it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	So , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	is it very usable ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	That's what I'm looking at . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	or 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Is 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	It 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	We have short time to to put it on the market , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	so that 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Mm Yeah well 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	and uh and uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	It's 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Uh because we we have a lot of languages . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	I d 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	And and 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Yeah . I think so . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	the remote away . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	it's not uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Yeah . Well yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	that's the right command . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	But 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	but 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Okay , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	but th that becomes your f Uh uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Well 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	I dunno . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	we have to make some decisions . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	you can see on the uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Okay , no speech recognition . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	we have to know what we're going to put on . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	Do 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	so you can see what other but buttons there are , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	okay ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Yeah , that's good . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Yep . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Okay , we just take that one . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	And what else , we have 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Also the one in the dark . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	So uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	It lights up when it's dark ? 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	I didn't 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	but it's 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	If you push something , it it all lights up . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Yeah . Yeah yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	but um 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	it it mustn't work all the time . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Yes , that's what I mean . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	So if you 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	Or you can switch it on or something . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	No , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Or maybe when you 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	It lights up all . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	You have to 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	That's what I said . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Okay yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	D 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Yeah , alright . Yeah . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	And do we use a a Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , if you can look through it . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	Or just a normal remote control . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Mm , maybe it's a good idea . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Different colours , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	uh maybe use even different fonts . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Oh yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Like uh phones . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Different colours . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Okay , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	so y you just make it th through You look through it ? 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Hmm . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	A see-through . Mm , that's cool . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	And so the buttons we have , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	this is , yeah , this is normal . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	We put in the the simple buttons on the top , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	It's the standard 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	Yeah , uh 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	But you have You had a lot of different buttons . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Hmm . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	maybe you have you have to 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Yeah okay , but Yeah , well 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	w 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	I think the buttons are very easy . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	With just uh standard buttons we just have so little 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	O 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	No , I don't need don't need 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	Because you ne almost never use it . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yeah , 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	but younger people I think um more often use the internet 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	and elderly people often use teletext . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	Yeah , that's right . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	So uh 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	I use teletext as well . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	No , 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	I use te teletext every day , I think . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Hmm . Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	Yeah . For me too , it is . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	we just keep it one level then ? 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yeah yeah , one level . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	Okay . 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Mm . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	I think the design is most important . 	
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	Yeah . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	'Cause simple buttons . 	
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	If you put one above it , it's clear . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	Okay . 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	So 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	that's it for toda for 	
TS3004b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um 	
TS3004b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
TS3004b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	How long is lunch break ?
