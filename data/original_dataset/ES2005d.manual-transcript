ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay . Sure . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	We made three for you . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Three ? Oh . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and the other one is st 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Tomato ? What tomato ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	I don't recall a tomato . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Look . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So . Okay , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Ah I see , okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	or as mm few buttons as possible , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	mainly speak recognition . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	The yellow there is the um 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Logo . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	the slogan , yeah , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	that we need to incorporate , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Okay , brilliant . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	it's very simple . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	um but mainly it's speech recognition . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah and 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Alright , okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Mm I'm not sure about that . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Right . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	That's groovy . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Uh can I have 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um that one is 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Oh sorry s 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Oh no , it's delicate . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	At Oh dear . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	That's that's already got its stand that one . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	That's it stand . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Alright , okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	It does also lie flat , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay , brilliant mm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um the black on the back is the slogan . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay , nice and obvious there , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Uh yeah , that 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Well , we did think of that . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Well , if you hold it , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	you can you all can hold it , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	is 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	it does actually feel quite ergonomic , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	if you've got small hands . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	It would have to be a bit bigger . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah , scale model , yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um that's a speaker at the top , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um and 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	um then the buttons . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Tried to keep it simple . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Alright , excellent . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	We used those . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It's not in the traditional place , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	but um it's quite an obvious place . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Excellent . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So there we go 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and and um we have the banana-based one too . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Oh yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yep . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Okay 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	A a more friendly type of 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	, so so Barney the banana . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Right , right . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Ah excellent , just what we need . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Say it for the camera . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Right , right . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Cool yeah . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Well , nice to have uh options at least . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yep . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	So are there any um improvements or issues or 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	'Kay and 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It won't stand . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Just let it lie down , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	it wont stand . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Oh . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Um unfortunately 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Mm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Oh . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So we have to 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	What's on the uh on the left ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	rea Sorry , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I've accidentally highlighted somehow 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	There we go . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Oh god , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Ooh . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	why is it doing that ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	There we go . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	More like a traditional remote control . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	And by doing so 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Oh no , hold on . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Doesn't save us quite as much . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I don't know what's going on with this again . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	W why is the uh double curved two of them ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Oh , good point . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And double curve on both sides ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Um . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Curve . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , this is double-curve , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	That's sort of curve in and out . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	no ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	This is double-curve . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Is i 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	It 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	This one is single curve . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	'Cause this is single curve , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	this is curved on both sides . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	So double-curve . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	No , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I think it means double curved as in um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Like an S_ shape . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Okay , I might be wrong though . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Hmm . Hmm . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Okay . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	A curvature is like the this case . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Maybe . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	got two of them 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	and why why I've got it two , I don't know , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	I can't seem to select any more however . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Well we can work around that 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Right . No . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Cut things out . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	But you think it should be one . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	It's meant to be one , yeah , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I don't know why I put two in there , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	but um 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Hold on till I find it , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I think this shift button might be stuck again . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	No maybe the shift button's stuck in . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Should 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Oh that's fine . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah , so we're 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Cool . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Cool . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So we could even add something . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	We should fire the accountants . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	What ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Fire the accountants . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Ah yeah , we could add things . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Does that work ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	No mm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Uh you can do one thing . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I don't know . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	You just select one box outsi 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	yeah , this box . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Then move it with the help of this 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Just uh just uh 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay , just a minute . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	No input , like this . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Shift . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	No it's not . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , it's not working . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Is it the other shift button maybe ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Should we ask Meli 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	No that's fine . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Did you try both shift buttons ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It could be the other side . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Cancel . Piss off . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	That's too bad . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Oh well , never mind . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Um . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Right , so that's finances 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	and I dunno what we 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	what could we reckon we could add ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Well maybe we could add something , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	but maybe if 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	What do you th 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	We're trying to save money , so . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Maybe 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	because it's not in an ideal place right now . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah yeah .

ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	How we are going to 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	means uh at what standard what standard 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	whether it meets our standards or not . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	How mu 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	What rating we will give to these products . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So of course this is will be a team work , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Then marketing strategy of the company . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Sorry . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Sorry , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	carry on . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	So 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I'm having this scale this scale , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	so we have to do it on a board . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Alright , okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	the user requirem I think . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	The board working again , is it ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Uh . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Um . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Thank you . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	There it is . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	So . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	First of all uh comes user requirement . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	I I will 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	first I would like to have your views , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I think 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah , it did . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	S 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um so . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Does it work ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	so yeah , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . So . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	So what do you think you will personally give . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	I would say seven . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Seven . Uh . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I can't 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	True or false ? 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	No sorry tr one is true . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	One , yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Uh one is means highest ranking , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But I think highest ranking is seven , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	or one ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	No that's false . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay , right right . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Okay , so one . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So it's one for from your point of view . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yep . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Uh . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	It's hard to know . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I I give it a two . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Uh d you can you can tell on on the like 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	But you can give your views based on technology , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Um 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I'm gonna give it a two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Two . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	And what about uh you , Brian ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Oh , I'll go for a one . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	You will go for one . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Uh for me personally it is everything fine , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	but there is one thing which limits the customers , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	like we are having only two , three designs , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah th 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Mm 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	and 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	yellow . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Uh yeah , lower end . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Come on that was the tha 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	'Kay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Being fruitist . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	two or three kinds rather , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	and 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Is that no is that not trends ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	So . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	So you can what shape a person will like . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	We were coming up with one product . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Uh maybe . Okay 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I'm just trying to 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	So we can 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	He's a tough cookie . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Three or four ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Uh , no sorry , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	it should be 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Six . Five or six . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	What are we doing ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	No 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	What are we doing ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Adding them up ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	we are doing a very wrong thing . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	We're gonna average them ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Okay . So seven fourths . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	and that's 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Oh . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I have taken it very wrongly . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah uh 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	About one point f one point eight . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	three four four two six seven seven sev 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah one pe exactly . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	So we can say one or two . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Oh I see . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah round it up to two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	So where were the trends . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	So trends . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Can you explain what you want us to write there ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Sorry ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	How it how conforms to the current trends ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah , again the the fashion trends , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Uh . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	so I would actually give it a three . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Tha three or four , I'm not sure . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Three . Go for three . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Okay . Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	That's fine . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Uh 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	but it's missing the screen , as we said , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	So I give it a a four . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Mm . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	for technology . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah , I am sort of pret uh 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Just the fruit does me in , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I mean uh it might 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	so um 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Okay . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	like , these products are in fruit shape , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	because that wha people now 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	So and in this way our product is good . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So that is also ef that also 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	And yes . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	It is cus spongy also . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	So they can play with it , it's quite good . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So then I think , maybe I can give it two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	So four five ten thirteen thirteen . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	So we can 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Is it fine ? 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	So what about company strategy ? 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Well it was yellow . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Um . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah , the company strategy , okay . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Um I feel I got my say . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Um so I'd give the company strategy a two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Okay . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah , 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Is that the question ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Is it ? Okay . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131		
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Um . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Okay , so 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196		
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	one or two . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	One . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I'll go with two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	So what about you , Brian ? 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Um yeah , 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	a three . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Mm . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah , and me also , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	So four six six 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So one and a half . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah , one . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	half . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	So we can say two or one 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	A two . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Okay . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136		
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	So th seven seven . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Uh overall we are getting two something , 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	but we can round it as two . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yep . 	
ES2005d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Okay . 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Cool , groovy . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . 	
ES2005d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	S 	
ES2005d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Cool . 	
ES2005d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	So we can launch it . Yeah .
