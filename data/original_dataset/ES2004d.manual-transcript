ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Is that someone's ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Is that . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Thank you . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	three , apparently . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Hmm . Hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	you all switched on . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Yep , me too . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	I presume we're good to go . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Okay , um 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	minutes 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	um we decided to use a kinetic charger , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	We wanted a stand-by function . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Okay ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Prototype presentation . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Is that for us ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	I think that would be you . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Yep . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Me and William worked on a prototype , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	shall I show ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I'll show . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Make sure the camera's 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I can hold it like 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	and I'll I'll show you the presentation . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	so 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Can I just nick your 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yes , yes you can . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Wait a second , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	I'll get it out . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Whoa . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	It looks 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Going a bit crazy over here . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	crazy . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Thank you . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	You should have one of those things 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um not now . Oh . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and you can just take it off . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Ta-da . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Oh , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	where are the hinges ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay , so 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Right . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	'Kay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	You able to look ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yep . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	um which there'd be sort of a wide choice 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	they would be attached , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	but we can we can come up with that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	. 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	The black and white touch screen 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	wherein people can 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Mm . So it's flush . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and the buttons at the bottom would d 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Right . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	so so it'll fully close flat . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Oh right , okay , yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And working on the inside 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	so that you could probably get a bit of 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	'cause it's the top part that's 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Or something . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	And then 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	'Kay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	I'm under the sofa . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Ah oka 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Or , that would be too complicated . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Uh yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	if it was going like I d 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	well 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	tha that could be something for next time , maybe . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Infrared . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Um it would it would have 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	it would need two separate P_C_B_s , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	we haven't 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	I don't think we actually put it on . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Like here . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yeah , yeah , something like that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Actually , no , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	it would be it would have to be on the on the front . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	. So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	It's still pointing , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	yes . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Yeah , that would make sense . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	And then finally um on to the interface . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	This one right here . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	. 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Which is 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	No . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	once it's 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Look up to it . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	as that is that's the company logo . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Thank you very much . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Wrapping it all up , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Well done . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Um I've now got evaluation criteria . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Certainly . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	So 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	this is the one . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Sorry . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	It's to be presented . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	There you go . . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Logged in ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Thank you . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Oops . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Evaluation . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	. 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm um I I think this is chip . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	It's quite similar to what it was before , though . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Sorry . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	So this is the first stage of the evaluation . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Now , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Now 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	The design should minimise R_S_I_ 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	and be easy to locate 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Okay , so 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	We're going to use a seven point scale , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	where one is true 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	and seven is false . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I'll call that slide back up , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Does that seem clear ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Any questions there ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Ah , it's perfect . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	So 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	we're going to look at these crite 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Yes , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	we're going to come to 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	w we'll discuss each one 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Is that okay ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	'Kay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	One is true , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	seven is false . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Right . So 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I won't write all of that out again . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	to confuse it with the number rating . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Just write small . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Criteria and rating . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and we could take an average at the end . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	How about that ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah . That works . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	so you can 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	One is true , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	seven is false . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	My own rating for that would be a two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	One is true 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	and seven is false . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I would agree . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I'll just go this way . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	'Kay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	two or three . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Two . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	No , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	three . Three . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I would say two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Two . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I would say four . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	A four , okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Uh two and three quarters , it that right . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Mm yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Almost three . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Two and three quarters ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	I think yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Okay , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I would give that a three . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	I'd give it a one . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Not that you're biased in that it the designer . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	No , no , not at all . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	A two . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Oh 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	sorry , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	I I got it wrong . The first one rating , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	I'm sorry . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Can you just make it two ? The first . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	The average 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I I just it the other way . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Uh in 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yep , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	I just got 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	I'll work out the average for that again at the end . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	It's a very slightly altered 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Okay , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	and we're just waiting for your rating 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	two point f 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	It's just two point five for that one . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	f 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Two point five , okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Losing one decimal place , that's okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	One is a , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	seven is false , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Two , okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	So that is eight . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	That brings it down to two , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	nice and simple , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Okay , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	ease of use . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Easy to use ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Two . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	I would say a two . I would say a two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	A two , okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Two . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	We'll just put almost two , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	One point seven f five . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Okay , mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Um mm now we're looking at 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	D_ . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	it incorporates current fashion trends , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	One . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Right . So 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	that's 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	No , no , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	White . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	With 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	for the plastic ? Uh blue . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Right . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Any 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Right . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yeah , yeah , yeah 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	And the spongy feel is no problem with that . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	and 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	No , no , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	In that case it's got to be a one for me . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yep . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Everybody ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	One . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	One . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	That part was nice and easy . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Mm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Okay . Uh 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	moving on 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Mm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	No . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	We've we've discussed it , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	We've talked about pointers , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Well 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	It's meant to be . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	it's meant to . Um 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	maybe because it's slightl 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	with the size that we've got it's quite small , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	So maybe because there's more space , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Right . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Right . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	and give it a four . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	A five , okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	'cause 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Four . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Four 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	and a four okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Four . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Twenty one is that twenty one ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	So that's four point two five . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yep . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Now we talked about voice recognition , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	we talked about a beeper , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	have we really 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Voice r recognition . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	It was the I'm here thing , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	yep . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	That sounds good then . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	I'd go for a I ca 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Um I think it would r 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	A standard . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	it would be quite loud . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	It would be . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Right . Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	So it would be s p 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	You built into the feature . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Logical . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	That's a one for me . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , one . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	One 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	One . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	and one , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	good . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	'cause it is our product , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	So , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	but 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	how do we feel about this ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	or do we have to make further modifications ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	I don't think so . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	W I thin 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	yeah , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	We happy to go ahead ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	I think 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I think we yeah . I think we're set . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Do much apart from having a huge big 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Mm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	I know . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Okay . Well , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	I hope that's uh clear to the team . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	before I sum up ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Don't think so . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	No . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Good . Fine then . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	I'll just leave it there . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Oops . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	thank you . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Okay , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	I've got finance here now . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	I'm gonna plug this in 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	so you can all see it , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	if that's okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Um . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Oh yes . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	You want me to b unplug that ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	That's all . Yes . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Thanks . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Right . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Now 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I presume that the screen will go blank , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	that um 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	We just type numbers into this 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	and we come out with the final value . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So are we still on for kinetic ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yes . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Um it might have influenced our choice . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Right , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	what's happening with the electronics ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	It was a regular chip on print 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Chip on print . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	and 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Double-curved . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Oh , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	no , no , no , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	the um 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	it's 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	there should just be one . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	In the top , it's the number 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	of c yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Oh , right , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Thanks . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	and 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	So , would there be two ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	yeah , just a 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	no , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	one reg v uh 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	One chip . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yep . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	And they're double curved . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	No . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Y 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Single-curved . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	One double curve . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Two , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	'cause it's two . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Two curves , yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	So 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	what's a single curve then ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	I'd say I'd say it was w 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	I think I think it's 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	So 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Single-cu 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	just one double 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Mm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	One double-curved . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah . Um 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	. 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	And one 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	no , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Plastic and rubber . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	and then the other one's 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	The other curves at the sides , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	but it's slightly flattened at the bottom 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Um we've got plastic and rubber , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	a plastic . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	haven't we ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Plastic one 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	and maybe rubber point five . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	And special colour . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	. 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	No 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Um 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	we can put point five . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Do you think ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	I think it allows the point five , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	We can use that . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	What does it mean if you put point five for that ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	It would be like saying we're using 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	See , it says case material . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	So 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	we're not actually using plastic in the case , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	No , no , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	are we ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	that's it's as an extra . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	It's including , it's including . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Right , okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	But it is gonna be part of the total cost , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	is there ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Or sh we should just put it in as one , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	because the plastic is zero anyway . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	No , we don't step on anyone's toes . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Okay , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	special colour , do we need that ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	N 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	yeah , okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Interface . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Push-button . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	the push-button's one 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	One . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	and L_C_ display one . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	An One . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	And buttons 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Buttons 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	S 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	I think we could change the battery also . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Has that not made any d 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	if you click off that square now , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	has that not made any difference ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Well 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Is it 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Has that not gone up ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	oh , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	yes . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	it's brought it slightly down . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Oh no , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	it was seven five 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	it's changed not a lot . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	So 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	is is uncurved completely 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	is that going to make a difference ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Uncurved , flat . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Oh , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	it's not made any difference , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	has it? . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	No , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	It's gone up again . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	No , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	we'll have 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	it just surprises one . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Oh , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	it's not calculated it . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	No , no , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	you've got to click off to calculate it again . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Oh . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Okay , there we go . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	It's brought it down slightly . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	It's not a lot though . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	C 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	it might uh 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	. I don't think so . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	It could be in Dollars . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	And then it would be fine , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	because the exchange range would make it about twelve . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Is there anything on the menu 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	No . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	I think 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	No . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Ri 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	I think it's in Euro . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Okay , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um and the interface . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	If we tr um . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	And going to a regular bat 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	the standard , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	it um it would make one difference . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	The biggest one would be taking away if you took away 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	If you to 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	It's internal , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	nobody looks into the battery . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	And people are used to buying batteries , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	If if you take away the voice , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	I I do I don't like to say it , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Should we see what difference it makes ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Where's the 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah i yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	No 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	where's the voice recognition ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Um 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Right , okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Well 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	the kinetic is three . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	They n n 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	but you p 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	minus three plus two . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Oh , right . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	I keep seeing zero . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Um We can do it some other way , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	we can do 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	it doesn't have to be voice recognition . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Sure . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	You could choose to have that or not . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	But they but I mean in 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	But we're still working to um head o 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	So should we just change the design specification then ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Make it costly . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	We can put in our recommendations . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yes . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	We c we could s 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	But we need to work to that specification to start with . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	we could say 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	but our object is so distinctive 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Okay , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	we can make the price fit , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	I s 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	And then say we recommend 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Mm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	because it also sets it apart from the crowd . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	They like their gadgets , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	they like something that's completely different . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	It's s something completely different associated with your company . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Right , okay , so 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	So if we take voice recognition out 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	That'll do it . Twelve point three five . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	we are . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	we are close to the budget . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Two five . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	It's two point five . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	No , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	it's twelve point two five . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Are you sure ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah well 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Right . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	isn't it ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	It's twelve point five maybe , then . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Which is less than ten P_ . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	I don't know what 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	it said fifty percent of the cost . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	I think the agenda one was where the um price was , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	So half of the price would be 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	wasn't it ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	No . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	I think it is the first one . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	That's today's 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	kick off meeting , . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Twelve point five . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Mm . I thought that's what it was . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Ah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	So we are under the budget . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Well done , people . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	So we're okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	So 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	is 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	We don't need something else to take that place ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	No . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Okay . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Okay . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Seems fine . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	I think that's brilliant . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Except voice recognition , everything is 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Right , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	so we've done that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Okay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Product evaluation . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	We've done room for creativity , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	haven't we ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . Um 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Yes . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	um in the sense that 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	um did you feel like a team ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Or did you feel like uh autonomy ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah , I'd say , as a team . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Although we had our separate tasks , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	I think we had a nice time . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	there was so much interaction , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Find out from each other , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	And I've certainly felt heard , listened to 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	and adjust our remit where necessary . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	It's not like people trying to cut each other . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Yeah , and uh 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah , I think . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Thank you . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	How did you find it ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah , no , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	I thought it it went really well 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	and I 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	but that's that's good . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	but 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	you know , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	y 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	it didn't matter it saying what you thought , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	'cause it was just another idea in the field . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	I like that . Um 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	teamwork . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Well 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Yeah , well . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	I think that was the best part 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Um uh I'm still not caught up . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	of the 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Maybe . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	'Kay . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	No , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	that was quite fun . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Discuss which ones 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Could it've been better , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	was it adequate ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Had time to kind of 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	moving around the room . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	But I think it's good , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	like uh we spent times individually . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	I think it's new ideas in general , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	rather than 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	it so it's 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	I mean nothing is new , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Mm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	but it's applying it to a d in a different area . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Vegetables . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	That's mine . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257		
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Yeah , no . Well 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	it's 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	they have to come from somewhere , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	don't they ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Absolutely , yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	The thing is 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	And as sh as w 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	sorry , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	you go . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yep , sorry , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	go on Sarah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	No . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	I mean they're slightly different , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	'cause it's w something we should think about , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	I do 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I don't think the the companies are really concerned . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	does anyone remember the remote control ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	just jazz it up a bit . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Mm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Uh d they don't really think about it , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	No . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	and they design it on Photoshop 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	and then they just get it printed on the plastic , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	you would pray 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	you would pay a lot extra , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	But people could have anything that they wanted . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Mm . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Because of the produ 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Mm . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	And new f television products coming up , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	but nobody giving uh much idea to this . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Like Sarah was telling , everything's 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Right . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	We see it in mobile phones a lot , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	There are innovations in that that people don't really want . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Yes . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	and they can't get it anymore 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	and it's innovation for innovation's sake , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Well , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	it's innovation for money's sake . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	The the people have to keep buying . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	But forcing it onto people , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	It's things that , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	you know , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	they might want to buy the thing they really want . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	And you can't get 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	you've got your handset that works fine , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Mm . Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	because the phones have moved on , things like that . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Yes . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	It's madness . Um 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	See I think 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	In closing There we go . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	Um our costs are below budget 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	with recommendations that they the budget be increased , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	but I think 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	I don't know , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	d 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	what do you think ? 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Well . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	I think that was just the the physical . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Maybe fifty percent more . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	I think 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	But I think but you were saying that that's quite 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	yeah 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	I don't from the market research . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	I think we've done what we were required to do , 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Hmm . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	No . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah , 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	it was 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	I think we've done very well to get within budget 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	and it still makes such an innovative item 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Mm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	that I think people are really gonna want . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	It's a shame it won't ever get made . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	I know . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Maybe it will . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	Maybe it will . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Who knows ? 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . 	
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	and sell it . 	
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323		
ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . 	
ES2004d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .

ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Oh , so 	
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with ,

ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor ,

ES2004d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196		
ES2004d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310		
ES2004d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks .
