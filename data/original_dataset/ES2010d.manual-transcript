ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	I wanna find our if our remote works . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Me too . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Oh . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Whoohoo . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and then we're gonna close it up , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and we have forty minutes , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	so 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	let's get started . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh , no , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	let's have the prototype presentation . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm 'kay , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	you ready ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um sure . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	You or me ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I'll be the Vanna . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and it's gonna be plastic . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Right . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Hmm . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	That's nice . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Good . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Great . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	And then on the side you have the buttons . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Okay . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I don't think they're scrolling . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	No . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	They're just buttons . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Right , yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	And then 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	yeah , the buttons . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	On off switch will be here 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	by concave sort of thing , 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	except for , you know , can't see underneath . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	because they're very 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Thumb-shaped . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	and then these are the numbers , 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	so our channel and our volume will be on either side . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	just which we didn't do . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I'd say a single . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Single . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Single . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Single sounds good , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Right . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah , 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	it's only actually the size of my hand . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Great . Great . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I think you did an awesome job . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah , I think it's a beautiful 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Good job , you guys . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Good job . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Oh thank you . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Whoohoo . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Those are really good . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Alright 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	what's next in our agenda ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	and that's with Courtney . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	it's a PowerPoint presentation . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	It's under evaluation . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Right . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Alright . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Feel good meaning what ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Like does it feel good , like 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Physically , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	yeah , physically . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Right . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	okay . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Sqi 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	That's just for current trend . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Right . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It doesn't really count , you guys . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	But it's 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	so we do have removable covers , right ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Right . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yes . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , well then that's covered . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And so we n k 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	'Kay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	everybody have that ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I'll wait . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah , she's got it . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It's good . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	so for easy to use , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	do we feel it's very easy to use ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Are we going to indi 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	True or false , easy to use . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I say we individually rate 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	what do you say ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	You guys 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Just orally . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Why not ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	We have 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	okay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um easy to use . I vote six . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Oh wait , that's false . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Oh , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	two . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I'd say two as well . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah , two . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Two . That's what I say . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh hello , we're great . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay , fashionable ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um one . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	At the moment , no . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	No . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	No . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Me too , very chic . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	I thi I would give it a one . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	One , I give it a one . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Oh , and ma it's a prototype , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	right . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	What do you think ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I'd give it like three or four . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Well , now I'm . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Okay . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So , the average is about a two . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah , it's a two . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	But then I'm not fashionable , so 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Two or three . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	don't use my opinion . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Two point five . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	That's okay . Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Um 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	does it feel good ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Imagine , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	since we obviously don't have that . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I feel like 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Does it feel good ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Uh the shape of it actually does uh . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	It's gonna be curved . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	it's gonna be thicker . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Depth . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	I think it feels good . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I think so too . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I'll give it a two . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	'Kay . Two . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I'll give it a one . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	What do you say ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I'd say a two . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Alright , average is two . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Is it technologically innovative ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Oh no , it's fine , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	you're I mean you're Project Manager . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Go right ahead . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um yeah , I mean and it 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yes . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Right ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	We were able to do it with that kind of chip . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Oh right , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	the 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	We could do it with the chip , yes . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	It wasn't 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	we have no reflection of it on the prototype , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah , right . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	That was 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	'kay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah , so . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And we discussed that being included . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Right . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Then yes , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	then I would 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	well it isn't 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	It 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	so I'd probably give it a three . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Right . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	But it is just a T_V_ remote . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I'd go for a three or four on that one , so 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah I go four . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	okay , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	let's go for a three point five . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Three and an half . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Alright , and the last criteria is it is it um 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Squishy and fruity . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Well , we've covered that with the 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	It's just trendy , basically . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	trendy . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	It's capable of being squishy and fruity . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Sure . Capable . Very capable . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And it's very important . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	'Kay , there we go . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Okay , next . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	So . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Next . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Good job , team . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	How did you get that in there ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	What ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	It does . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	It it does . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	That was good . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Thanks . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Very good . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Alright , let's go back to this 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	No , that's it . Hmm . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Oops . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	If so , we can proceed , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	'Kay ? So let me bring that up . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Here we go . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Alright . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yep . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Two . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Number of components you plan to use . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Do I just put quantity being one battery , or 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	But if it's a 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	do you wanna go for 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Oh , let's just go for a lithium . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	What do you say ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	I think uh 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	it's . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	We're gon that's gon 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Nologically advanced , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	right . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay , down to the electronics um section . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yep . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	so one of those . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	It is a single-curved , so one of those . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Oh . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	What's that ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah , that's correct . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	'Kay , down here , case material . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	It's plastic . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	We 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	plastic . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Plastic . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And special colour . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	And special colour . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	'Kay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Down here , interface type . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	No , we don't have the scroll . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Isn't 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	oh those are just regular buttons . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	But it's 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Well , that's the push-button too , right there . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Buttons . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	but i so i 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	This ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	We're really having just push-button interface . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	so we can just go um . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	But will we w actually we'll need two , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	won't we ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	But it that just covers the type of button we're having . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Push-button . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	push-buttons . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Right I think she's 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	But we just have push 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	But we don't have any scrolls . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Right . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	I don't know , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	they might put us 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	well , let's just . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Two interfaces , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	is that what w should we s say ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Let's call it th 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Two or would it be three ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Or three , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	because of one on each side and one on top . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay , fine . Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Well less than twenty nine even . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Okay 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	and we're gonna 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	button supplements the buttons are no 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	They're a special colour . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	uh okay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Are they ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Oh , right . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	And then s 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And , they're a special material . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Mm . Well , we're under cost then . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Alright . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	We're over ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	No , we're under . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Grand . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	We're under . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Twelve point five is our limit . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Oh , I see . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	We've got eleven point two . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	So we can go to production . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Alright . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	We can go to 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I dunno what I just did . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Okay . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Now we're gonna talk about the project process 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	um teamwork , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	and if we found any new ideas . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Now , question is , how do we do this ? 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Go back . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	I think we just discuss it . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Discuss , sure . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Previous . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Alright . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Who want who would like to go first ? 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	We didn't have a whiteboard . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Hmm . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Oh that's true . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Hmm . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And no internet . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	No , yeah , that's a good point . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	We got to choose basically we had control over 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Right , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	and also how fashionable , which I kind of like 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And we're a fashion forward technology company . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	we 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	yep . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	right . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	You know it . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I think we did well . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	I think ya' did . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Did you work well together in there , and 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yep . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	'kay . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Minus that one fight .

ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Irritating . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Irritating . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Irritating , yeah . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Irritating . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Okay . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	The means , the whiteboard didn't work . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202		
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	And no internet . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	I have to knock that one down a couple notches . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah , and no internet . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Misses . I do .

ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Like it's information 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah , digital pens . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I really appreciated those , yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	were 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	they were pretty cool . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	They were fine . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	but they are awesome . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	The use of the laptops for receiving everything . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	It was wireless too , so . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Right , laptops are extremely handy , 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	wireless . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	And these things whoa . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	And Big Brother . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Big brother . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Um we are really gonna sell this . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213		
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Ta-da . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think I mean that's not what technology . 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same .

ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah , 'cause they're pretty 	
ES2010d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	and that's so old-fashioned to me . 	
ES2010d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	and just like 	
ES2010d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids .
