TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	I don't think it's very interesting . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	I think it is . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Oh nei . Uh no . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Alright . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	This is copy paste . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	So 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	From me of course , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Of course . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	You had some very strange layout . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	It's a nice chorus , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Well um 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	We ge we went through the agenda , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	And uh I summarised what you said to us . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Repeat it yeah . Alright . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	So uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	This is what we decided . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	It's also copy paste from what we made together . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	So we still know that . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Okay . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Alright , we both uh will ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Or one of us will ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	No you go 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	and I'll uh supplement you . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	If I make mistakes uh you'll uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Correct . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Right . Uh well 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	this is our design . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	With uh the different uh perspectives of it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Uh we'll begin uh with the front . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Um with uh the upper part being the front . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	And uh we're we're using different colours . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	because it's also titanium . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	You can see it also on the on the on the side view , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	that only this part is the front , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	and has the titanium colour of course , the look . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Mm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Yeah , it's a double R_ , but 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Yeah ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	It's a double R_ . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Yeah , alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Okay . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Then we have the buttons . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Oval yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	So uh oval , n those are here . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	And then we have the m 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	The m 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Channel up and volume ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Um um with kind of arrow shapes , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	We have the Okay button . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Oh nei 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	And then we've here the Menu button 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	and the 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Alright . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	And the video button . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	The 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Mm right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	So 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	'Kay . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Uh this is what we made of it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Well if I look at it , the side the side view 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Well , at the back 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	and then you can add suggestions . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Oh yeah alright . Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	No the back . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	With the logo and our uh l uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Yeah the back . Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	We thought about 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	And we thought about the logo big in the middle . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Just so again the double R_ . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	We have then the logo on front and on the back . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Maybe that's too much 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Okay . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	No I don't think 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	And the 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	That's basically what we were thinking about , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	and 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Okay . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	W 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Well I see , but 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Well . Yeah I see it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Yes . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Well , it won't be visible . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Mm ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Why ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	mean uh the the the the 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	If y 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	In the middle in the 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	You you have it a bit uh Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	It depends on the size . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	If it's kinda small , this is is great . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	And how large is it ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Yeah , that's the question . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	That's the question . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Uh well Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	H What do you suggest I mean we do ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	This was Mike's prototype , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Well uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	and y you seemed to agreed on it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	But now you have a totally different . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Well , they lay there all the time . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	The size ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	They the the the the the side view , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Side ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Uh oh the side ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	we didn't uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	W we we he drew the s the side , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Well any case , we'll discuss it now . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	But you you hold it like this . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	you you don't you don't grab it , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	You're not holding it like this or something . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	you you 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Well y y y you don't have it like this . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	You have it more like this . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	No no no . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	You you you're using buttons this way , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	or if you're right-handed , this way . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Like you're holding your telephone . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yep . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	So you Yeah . So 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah well 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Okay . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Yeah , I agree on this . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	so Well 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	No , I don't think so . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	That's not uh the point 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	No but but 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	and only Nils 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah well 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	But you're the Project Manager , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	you can make the hard decisions . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Yes . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	So uh I c I c 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	If necessary . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Alright , if you think that that's the way it should 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Y Yeah , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	No No , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	But do you 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	But In the market uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	No not totally . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Not totally , well 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	For me , I I wouldn't buy it . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Let's say it like that . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yeah but of course 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	y you are also human . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137	We have to take uh every everyone into account . So 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	No 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	And you might be uh You might be target customer . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Well uh who who else thinks like you ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yes but 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Mm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	We don't know . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Maybe a thousand people , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah , we don't know , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	or a million people . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	So let it be like this at uh at this moment . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Let it be . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Alright . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Okay ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	So that's that . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Uh any other suggestions ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	No , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	I think it's great . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	But what about the redesigning ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Comes to that later . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Okay . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Um you . Uh c You can uh Walter . You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	You're very personal again . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Alright . Great . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	That's more useful than just speaking . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Well , this is just a short intro . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Yes . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Well , I put some questions in a Word file . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	See if I can find them . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Uh uh uh uh mm . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	'Kay . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Well 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Hmm . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	so uh I don't have to explain it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Seventy five percent of them . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So what do we think ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Well d we designed it , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	so of course we are very 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Mm . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	No , I know , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Well we designed it to be good-looking . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	but I have to uh evaluate it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	So I have to take this questionnaire . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	So and we ha we have answer now ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	To the customers ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah , but I can't can s 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Hmm . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	But um Well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Uh do we find it good-looking ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Well we think so . Uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	I Yeah , I think it 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Yeah , but uh , you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	So But we have to be critic critical about it . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	So we we know where we stand . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Well , one . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Well so it's point four . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Right , so 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Easy to find t 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Right . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Uh is it good-looking ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Well , I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Two . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	That was our target audience of course . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Uh it's it's not f a device that 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	The titanium might be uh f for older people . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	it's it's more that classical look . So 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	It you put uh put a black front on it or something . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Hmm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Uh no . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	I think 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Yeah they like black of course , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	So I think it's very good-looking 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Right . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	and not only for youth uh young people . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	because I don't know how how many points there are but uh 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	No . I totally agree . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah , the fourteen yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	We we have to get get on , go through this . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Right , a number please . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Is it easy to t change channels ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yeah well I think so . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	So the last one is seven . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Easy to change channels ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Um , no it's uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	No , not false . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	It's one . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Oh , sorry . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Yeah , right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Well uh two ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Change channels ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Y Well we have to go through it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Right . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	So I Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.175	You How can you make it any easier ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	With two huge buttons . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Yeah , huge is a Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Yep . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Two . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Two ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Alright . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Well , no . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177	D we d we don't we don't have uh that s 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	We didn't implement anything about that . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Well six then . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	because of the colour . But 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Yeah .

TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Six ? Right . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Are the functions easy to learn ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180	but um um 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	We have so few functions , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	so Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Well , I should I think two , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	because the voice recorder is n not self learning . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Ah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Yeah .

TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Yeah , but just do some We we 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	I th I th I think this is too time consuming . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Are we take too much time ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Uh not not towards you , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	No . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	but towards this all . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Th this is 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Right , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	We you have to put it to the customers . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	R_S_I_ sensitive ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Uh well well a bit , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	so four .

TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	One . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	One . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	And features included also one . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	And One . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Uh we still think so . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Device fancy feeling . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	And I think fancy-feeling too , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Yeah , cool man . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188	because of the titanium back . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Are there enough technology ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Yeah well also we have two . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah , that's great . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Is the device easy to use ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	The 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yes 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	we have not many buttons . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.190	So well maybe two 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Well , with the uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	because of the voice recorder . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Two two . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Two , three .

TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	One or two , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	another two . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Nah 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	f four I think . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Four ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	If you look at this 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	No . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.197	But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Oh okay . Okay . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Well three . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Three , alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.198	And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Is the material attractive ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	But 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm . Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Well the titanium is strong , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	So I would say at least two . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Okay .

TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Well Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	This is the last meeting ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Yes , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	but we we have to design much more , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	The average will uh come later . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Um 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.199	I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Oh . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.200	There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Yes . Well , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	look at the costs at this point . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.201	My god . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	I had to fit it in . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	It has to go to twelve , right ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	I twelve and a half . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Twelve and a half . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	So 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Well what costs a lot ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	The sample spea costs four . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.202	The what ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.203	The 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	The sample speaker , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Out . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	the s sensor . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	That's easy . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Kick it out . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Kick it out . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	The what ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	We have to go to twelve and a half . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	The speaker . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	The speaker costs far , by far the most . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Oh . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	That's some wrong info , man . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	It it isn't worth it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.205	No . No , d th No . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	No . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	We could make two different versions , one with and one without . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	It's uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	But for this 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	It's just extra . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Kick it out . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	So , zero .

TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	What more ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Batteries are uh quite 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.207	No . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	L_C_ three ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on ,

TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	w a remote control has a battery . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.208	N 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Because uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.211	the L_C_D_ screen .

TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Yeah ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Hmm . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Can't we do that with a regular chip ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.213	No . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Why not ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Because uh that uh y 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.215	because my information says it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Huh ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . Regular is normal . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	And simple ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Simple . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Nothing . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Elementary . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Yeah , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Well ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.219	I I read something about it , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Your part . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.220	but it wasn't very clear . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.221	I d I didn't in include it in my report . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	What happens if we do 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Single 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Well you have to use a chip . So 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	How much do we win ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	We we we 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	One . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Why ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	We have very little options furthermore , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	for the 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.225	But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Uh well we have to put that in . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.226	That that's a fact . Uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	No 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah , but 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Yeah , but it's only one half . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Nah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	No , that's n It's not relevant . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Uh it d it doesn't 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	then you s then you only have one half left . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	You must change the chip back , Nils . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Uh yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.229	But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	No , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Then the whole concept is uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Yeah , I know 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.231	but that's what my information says . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.232	I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Hmm . No we oh 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	You 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	You can make you can make it cheaper . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.233	You have to use it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	But if you don't sell 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	and we have an L_C_ display . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	I think that's a bit double . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Yeah ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Y we don't need both . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	No , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214	the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.234	For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Says . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Says , his Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Because we you have uncurved 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Well I I did single curve to 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Well you said s double curved , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	I ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	uh he , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	No 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	We can also make it flat . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Well 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	no no no . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.239	But what what did what do n 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221	But 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Sorry , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.241	but What do they mean with the curves ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Is th Is this a curve ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Curved ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Yes , that's curved . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.243	One curve ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yes . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.245	It's how you It's how you look at it . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	No , it's one curve . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	One curve . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	One curve , simple . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Well then we have a huge problem I think . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.247	W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	We have a big financial problem . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Well we make it more expensive to buy . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Well , then we have two dollars less profit . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Come on , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.248	But uh I 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Yeah or we could replace it 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	If you if you make it cool to have 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	By the way , we also have this one . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Oh , that's just great . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Oh , costs nothing . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Oh , alright . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	That's nice . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Plastic is 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Yes , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	but I just got it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Well that's pretty uh l 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	That is pretty stupid . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.251	N not very practical . Well 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	uh titanium-coloured plastic ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Who ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	You want to dump the titanium ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.252	But I'm n I don't agree . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.253	I think 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Ah no no . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	It's not ugly looking . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	The looks remain the same . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	No , I don't think so . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Y 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Well , I do think so . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.254	I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Yes . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243	And the feel , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	feel . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	and th that it is strong , and 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.255	And also the the older people will like it because of that . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.256	And because i 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Alright it's not our target audience , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.258	but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245	We still 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.259	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	but not lose the one 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.260	I think the titanium is very important . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah alright 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	but then we we won't get there . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Yeah we have a problem , yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.262	W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	We can dump the special colour . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	We l we use plastic . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	And plastic is already in colour I think . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Well what else ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.264	W I mean uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	No , nothing . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Or you shou It's 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Amen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Or change the titanium 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	or dump the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Because you have lots of functions in it too . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Yeah , well yeah . Alright . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Why can't I 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.267	I agree with that . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	But 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.268	So we u we use uh Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.269	So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	I I'll talk to the managers . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	No no no no . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	W Titanium stays there . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Yeah this is good , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Osl 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.275	but it it's not good enough . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.276	So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	Ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Well 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Come on . Riot . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.277	What do we Well what do we know ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.278	All we want is a is a fancy design 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.279	but we don't really consider the costs . So 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.258	Yes , yes . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	No 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	because we did not know anything about it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	If you don't have the money , you can't make it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.280	Yeah al alright , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.259	One and a half Euros . Hmm ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.281	But we have to deal with it now . So 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	So s 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	If you don't have the money , you can't make it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	So this is too expensive . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.260	So ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.282	So 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	So we have to make it cheaper . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.283	Titanium gone 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.284	and add plastic . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Right . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Yeah , but then we've got money left . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.285	And on plastic times two 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.286	and then we uh are there ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Well , no it's just uh all plastic . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.287	No 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Well alright . Huh . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.288	No yeah well 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Oh six . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	It's just free , man . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.290	A lot of plastic , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Four . So 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.291	No two for the to make it clear . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.264	But then we can add the special colour ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.265	As we have money over uh left . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Yeah . W 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.266	And we still have money left . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.267	What do we want , guys ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.292	I want gold plating . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah right . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.293	No no um 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.252		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	I want chrome . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Well I think uh the case is double curved then . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.268	Yes . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.294	We have we have to uh fill 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Because you y have that curve 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	and you have that curve . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Well , th that that is the problem . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Y Oh no . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.295	W we ha 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah well uh 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.270	Alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.296	No no no , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.297	but th that's not f um 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Safe . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Well y we have curves in all directions . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.298	Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.299	And that we dropped , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.300	so it it can be done . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.272	So alright . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.301	But it's pretty funny . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.302	We we do want to reach twelve point five . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.303	But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.273	Finance ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	I mean , this this ain't titanium , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	but it looks like it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.304	We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Well , guys ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.275	Guys ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.276	We have to dump our titanium , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Shoot . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.277	and we'll hate the managers for that , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.278	but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.305	Objection . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Pro project . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.279	project . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.280	Well , satisfaction on for example , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.281	are we satisfactory about our creativity ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.306	Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.307	I think it's uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.308	Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.282	I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Yeah , me too . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.283	That's really bad . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.309	Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.284	But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	And uh unrealistic . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.285	but also for our creativity . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.286	We had um nice design , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.287	and then you get the cost , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.288	and you had to dump all your creativity . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Well we we we used our creativity , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Right . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	but we just had to adapt it to the costs . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.310	Which isn't very practical , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.311	but that's the way . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Nei . Uh no . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Yeah .

TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.297	But o alright , the teamwork ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.313	Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.314	It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.298	No 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.299	they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ .

TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.317	Yeah 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.318	but they base that on on the user specifications .

TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.300	Alright ,

TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.270		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.319	It was a complete disaster . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ? 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.320	No Uh it it it uh it is uh

TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Or not ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.321	No it's other way around . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.322	That's the SMARTboard . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.323	That's the digital panel . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.306	I liked this SMARTboard , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.307	but I hated that one . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.308	Well it's both a SMARTboard . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.324	That's that's the smart 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah right . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	B but you 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	This is just a large t large television . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Oh they're both SMARTboards . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.309	No . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	You u you use the 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.325	A televi Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.310	It's both a SMARTboard , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.311	but this one is used for a desktop , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.312	and that one is used to to draw . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Yeah , but you ca 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	This is just a beamer function . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.313	Well , wi w which one did you like ? 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164		
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.328	Yeah . Left or right ? 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.192	That one . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.314	That one . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.193	That one isn't accurate . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.194	It just doesn't work . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.315	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.195	You can 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.316	Yes . Th that is so . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.329	Well I didn't use uh 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.317	We're now talking about the SMARTboards . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.197	I don't need a SMARTboard . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.330	Nei It it's much m 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Well we we used that one , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Yeah , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	and we needed it . I think . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.199	but give me a beamer . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.200	That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah alright , but 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.318	Or install a laptop to a beamer , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.319	or have this one standing here in an 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.320	I I like it . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Right . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah I like that one , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.321	Okay , alright . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	but that one is terrible . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.331	But uh you can uh 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.332	I I sent it about three times now . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.333	Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.322	Yeah . Yeah , it is . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.334	The simple uh sch school board . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.323	So 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.203	I agree . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.324	And uh the digi the digital pen ?

TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.204	No . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.335	I I didn't use it . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.336	I wrote things down 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.337	but I didn't import it into my laptop . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.326	I used it uh just to check it out , but uh 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.338	That's the 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.327	You you can't send that to anyone , 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.328	because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.207	It isn't practical . Right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.329	and then you're going to send it , yeah . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.330	Well , no . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.339	W But also y you write things down . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.340	And i you can also bring your your your note block . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Your notepad . Yeah . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.341	So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.331	It's , no , it it's useless . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Well I I drew this . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Mm . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	And I made a mistake . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158		
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.332	Yes . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.342	Yeah alright . For drawings , 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.333	For drawings , yes . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.343	but not for personal notes . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Yeah for drawings . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.344	I think that's not very 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	N notes mm . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.345	Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.346	and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.334	But 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.347	If you've If you've 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Mm . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.335	But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.336	Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.337	And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.338	So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.271		
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Yeah , right . 	
TS3009d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.339	So it doesn't d doesn't have any 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167		
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.211	That Stefan use . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.348	Yeah I understand . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.349	But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.350	You can't 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.351	It's not very uh ni 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.212	No , I don't think so . 	
TS3009d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.352	Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah . 	
TS3009d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.213	It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Yeah . 	
TS3009d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	But then uh it's really useful , I think .
