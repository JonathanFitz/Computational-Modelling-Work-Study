$d@nite:id	$d	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	that um 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	are a bit uh 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	So the all in one idea goes out the window . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	And they require that the uh 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	So um , presentations , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	were you anybody got , raring to go ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Raring to go ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . Good stuff . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Mm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um . So how 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Oh I need to plug you in . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	S 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Wow . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Just about . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	It's a inspired design . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Sh do you want me to hold it ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh there we go , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	just screw 'em on in . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Gonna have to swap them round so 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	now , it was function F_ eight . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	So , after that ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	F_ eight . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	f oh sorry F_ eight . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	That's the wee blue one . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Blue one F_ eight . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Should do it , good one . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	sorry , yeah sure . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Hold on , sorry . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Sorry , uh . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , thank you . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	uh , like consumer likings and everything , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	what is the potential for this product 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Then 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	P press F_ five to start it first . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Sorry . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . Yeah , I can , okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Jesus . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	And what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	They are not so good looking . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So , we have to put stress on this , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So even if the available market goes for the available 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Excellent . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Then 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So we have to take care of this fact also . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Then . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh it was function I want to go to . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Uh , escape , okay 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	thank you . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Then if we look at this slide , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	like 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Uh , sorry . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	So , sorry 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I was just gonna say , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	what was the question for this ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Or is are you coming on to that ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So these percentages are are what ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , these are different age group persons 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	like uh 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	sorry , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I can open it in another way . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Okay . Speech recognition . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Uh , yes . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So we can emphasise on this point also like , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So we should look 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Mm , mm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So , and 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	And then 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Fifteen to twe 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yes . I think so . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So um this is all about 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	uh market potential by me . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Uh , yes , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	th thank you .

ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Uh F_ five . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	F_ five 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Escape . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	User Interface Designer sorry , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	and um I'm I'm also 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Uh just a left uh 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	The arrow ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	left mouse button . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So um I looked at existing designs 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So um what they like and what they find fashionable . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	'Kay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	And ergonomics , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	we said um , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	but um maybe that comes up , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I don't know . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	That can come under Arlo as well . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	And the findings , well 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	That's what people want to do . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Uh . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um , so they need to be included , um , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I don't know how to get to them , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	do I press F_ five is it ? escape ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Oh okay , cool . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	You know they're grey , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	'Kay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	they've 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	I mean this one's got loads of buttons , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	and they don't look very exciting at all . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	and I think we can do much better than that . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	We hope so . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Of course . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Um 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	hang on . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	F_ five , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	okay , sorry . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Personal preferences . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Organic . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	not too many buttons 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Sales , . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah it's like a , yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	It's . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	but um anyway um so hand-held and portable 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Right . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	so maybe we forget about that . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	And so the last thing I thought 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	w which I quickly mentioned in the other one 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Exactly . Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And I think that , yep , that's it . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	That's cool . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Um , or if 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	is that a function we want in the remote ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um , I haven't been able to 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um , do you have trouble whistling ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Really ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Ooh . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Yeah 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	it just 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm-hmm , yeah 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah , I suppose that's true . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	or some sort of voice 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	That's costly though . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Sounds good . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , something . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Well , uh let me set this up . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So I plug it in , press F_ five ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Function F_ five ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Function F_ eight for the um the uh 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Or function F_ eight ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . I think it's uh just to lock it in . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It's got it . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Alright . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	um so it's good you went first , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Let's remember that . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	and uh 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	he mentioned that they're not fun to use . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	there could be a little microphone on it , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well maybe you could have a 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	um hmm 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Um . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	um and not computery , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	So I took these all into consideration 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	and also I have some limitations from the boss . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Right um , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And so I did a little research 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Ah is that what that is ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Or uh or a high speed train . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Right 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well that's cool . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Right . So , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah sure . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I figured , just put 'em all together . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Right okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Well I like that design . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	So I think I I missed the budget thing , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	it was fifty million Euros ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Right . Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	not a problem . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Fifty million was uh prof 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	As a profit . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	gotta make profit , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	cheap plastic uh , you know , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	um , we don't wanna have it 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Uh . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Or a little base station or something , . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Um , I hadn't thought of that . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	That might cost more though , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	A battery in it , kinda . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Right , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	so so 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	the unirs the user interface 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	behind our product . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	and um 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	uh non volatile memory , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , me too . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Oh okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Right . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	That's all I got . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	'Kay , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	thank you very much , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	um I'll take that back . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Ooh that's tight . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	so didn't manage to forward it on to you , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	it is 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	let's see , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	I'll find it myself , um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Ta 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	nah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Just push it . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Um it's only for the television , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Corporate colour . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yellow . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yellow . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	I presume . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Uh , where am I ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	'Kay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Uh , now , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	we had as listed options we had 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	speech recognition potentially , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	we also want to limit the number of buttons 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	so we'll pretty much take that one as read . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	We'll use the the basic functions for a television . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	No teletext . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	okay hold on . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Not enough buttons you mean ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Well 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	or it looks like we're just cutting on the um 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Mm-hmm , okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay , cool . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	or maybe they'll send 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	About cost . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	some information about that , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	about um what people , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay um . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	However that does sound a bit like the 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	said people didn't like . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Although I guess if there's a sort of 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	um it goes to a different selection of buttons , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	so it sorta keeps it simple . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Um 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Uh . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Glow in the dark material I was thinking . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	So 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	I 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Uh may I say something about ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	But 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Often lost s was that , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Lost , yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	yeah are lost 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	That's cool . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Mm-hmm , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	That's cool . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	so we should take it into consideration also . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay , cool . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Um 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	speech recognition I take it 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Oh it's 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	I don't , I've 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	They're act there 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Really ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Right , right , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	'Kay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	but if you can work around that that noise problem 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Well what about 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	this might get a bit too expensive actually , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	you know like the ones that we can't hear or something 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Ah , that's a good idea . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	If you find if y 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	or not a remo I'm sorry , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	That we should just stick on , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	That comes with our remote control . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	which 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Right , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Right , right . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Right , right . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Um . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah that's certainly possible 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	It might do us out of a job . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Um so I think rather than 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Mm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	And the expense . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	so I th 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	yeah and expense and the time . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	So I think if we're going to go 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Um , but I guess not 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Um uh 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Is that 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Um . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Maybe not even all of it 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Contrast contra well . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	So if it's dow it's d uh 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Or if it's down under the couch cushions 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	um which is where I usually find mine . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Right . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Okay , well we can use 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	'cause what I thought , main 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	um if we're gonna have to 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	if we're gonna have the logo on as well , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	bright yellow logo in our our um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	slogan . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Slogan , yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Right . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	That was more of a a gimmick . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Do you think ? 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Um , okay so scratch that . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Uh so we've got 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	I I think 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Um 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	you know they get thrown around , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Mm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	They're pretty fragile . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Um no , I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Uh 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277	So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Um . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Uh you were finding out about teletext . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.282	If you could find out that uh 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	she they wi 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Oh . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.284	um expensive , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah you think so ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.285	no ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Oh right , okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Is it not the circuits that cost 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	like a 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Oh right , okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Um . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Five minutes . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Decisions . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Uh , votes , let's vote . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Who wants T_F_T_ ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.297	No-one does . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Excellent , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.299	so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Mm-hmm , that's cool . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.301	And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.302	programmability . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Glow in dark . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Uh 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Uh o okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.305	And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Okay , so . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.308	So , it just helps me summarize them . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Here ? Sure . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.309	And um I'll put any 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.310	I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.311	so uh 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	And where is it sorry ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Uh pro uh project documents . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.313	On 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So it should be when you save 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.314	A_M_I_ scenario controller . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	on your desktop , so it goes save as , or 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Oh . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Uh it is in shared documents ? 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Where am I ? 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Projoct uh projector . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Again . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Right and then project documents . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Okay , cool . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Hmm . It is not giving anything . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.317		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Shared documents . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.318	And I will tr 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.319	getting strings of um information , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.321	I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.322	as soon as I get them now , rather than 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.323	I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.320		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Mm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Did you get my email ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.324	I did . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Just making sure . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.325		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.326		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.327	So 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	it's a bit more bouncy , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	like you said they get chucked around a lot . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	The rubber rather than 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.331	More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Wow . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Um but we have to take care like 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.328		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	But we have to take care of our children also 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	if they 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	So , whatever material we use it should be yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.333		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Okay , safety . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	I dunno , I mean 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.336	It sme 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	We could go comp yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.337	smells good for children . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.338		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	And it's got the thing on the inside . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	And there's no buttons at all , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150		
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	That's a good idea . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.339	That sounds , 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	And then ch children will love it . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.340	yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Interesting . 	
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Please God no . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.342	Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean , 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	No . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.343	my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.344	I think just having it 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Having a little bit . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.345	surrounding the logo . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Okay cool . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Mm mm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.346	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Mm-hmm , okay . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Cool . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.347	And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.348	what was it ? 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.349	We put we put fashion into 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Whoops , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.351	it's not working . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Can't believe I've forgotten it . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.353	We put the fashion in electronics 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Oh yeah , that's a good one that . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.354	. I bet that'll catch on well . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yeah so . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Okay , any last 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.356	worries , queries ?

ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Hmm . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.359	I know what you're thinking . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246		
ES2005b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Okay then , lunchtime , 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.361	yay . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	That's good . 	
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one . 	
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156		
ES2005b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
ES2005b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.363	This is quite fun actually . 	
ES2005b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Wow .
