IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Very good . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .

IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I goin I'm going to share with you . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yep . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	You showed us 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	you ar you you prepare something for us ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah . Yep . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mm . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Alright so 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	So , I just put d quickly Remo , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Any ideas ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Uh the Powerstick . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Powerstick , yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	What else ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	What else ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Uh . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Maybe a Spanish name would work well . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Mm I was thinking of the 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mando . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Mando . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	What is that ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Mango ? Mango ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mando . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mando . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	M_A_ ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	M_A_ ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	A*_N_ yeah D_O . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	M_ D_O_ . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Mm , okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	What does it mean ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	but maybe for a Spanish for I for 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Oh . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	What does it mean in Spanish ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Control . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Control . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Hmm . Nice . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	because you know men like to have control of the remote 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	But 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	mm , yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	so it might 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Mando sounds Latino . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	The Mando . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So , let's go for Mando ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah ? No objection ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah that's . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Great . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And we could have some like you d 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	you could have the fonts you know special , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay , I think this is 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	do you ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	So 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	they are the most T_V_ watcher . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So we should be careful . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay , I think this is more a question of of 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	But 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	yeah 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Marketing . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	it uh 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Something that should be addressed later 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	We should we should go to other for the other topics . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah because if the product will be international 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Well that's the thing . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah okay , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So let's go for the three presentations right now . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So , who want to start ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Maybe maybe I should uh start . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Mm . Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay so I have your slides somewhere ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Should be in participant four . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Participant four . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	This one ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	S that's coming . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yep . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	okay . Great . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I prepare a marketing report 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Sh next slide ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	which is which is good and it's interesting point . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Also the people are worried about about the R*_S_I_ disease , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	They are also 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	And also I found that young people 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Liklier or more likely ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	More likely . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	likely . Okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	cut out some a lot of your market . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I dunno 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Well maybe it could be a universal design . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Sorry ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Sorry ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	The first and the third point , they are clashing . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Like uh 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah , like 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Little sleek , longer ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	No no 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And it should fit the hand . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	I was thinking of so like something 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Something with the shape of the palm ? 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Some finger grips maybe . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	On the sides . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	but 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Not anymore . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	That's what 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	And then finally 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	because uh because 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	No . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	No , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Um they want also uh 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Excellent . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	if if we're 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	but um yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah yeah . Sure sure . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yep . Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Sorry , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	what is your ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Uh participant three . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	so yeah yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	uh channel fifty . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	No 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	it could be command control kind of thing . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Means you say 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Otherwise it's just lying idle . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Okay Michael . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	be easier to 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Sorry ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	could I use the mouse , or 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm . Thanks . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	The wheel doesn't work . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Great . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	but it's not really 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Looks like a P_D_A_ ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	yeah it doe 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	it's 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	um is it's 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Change the channels . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Now um 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	uh the 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	I usually use the up and down 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	so that's just uh it's annoying . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Now um 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	One possibility , if we 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	now we need to still talk about the price point 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	but um we we really need t to discuss the price . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	So , I mean there are 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	there are uh cheaper 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah well we w 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Because the same button is doing too many things . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	I I would 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	They don't really do anything . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Maybe you know I 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Um 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It does sampling out of the . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Well I guess that depends on how you market it . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	If you 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	If y 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Okay , can you continue , please Mi ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So , but 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	yep . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	um which maybe maybe is too expensive , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I think even that , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	um but I think that would be quite useful as well . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	but , you know , later on you could you can you know you 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	also , selling the potential of the device . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Okay , thanks . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	you want to go ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yep . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	that means on my own I 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	This one ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	yeah , it should be . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Great . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	No , not that one . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	you are two . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Two . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Alright . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay so the working design is uh 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	user i interface could be of two types , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	sorry to interrupt you , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	That's right . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Okay . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	so th that is a possibility . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	These could be other kind of interfaces . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Otherwise we are just like others in the market . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	That increases the the cost also . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Uh that's right . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	That's right . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	No it it could be little d yeah it could be 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	So it could be s a few centimetres . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	That's right . That's right . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	So we can 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	That's right . Yep . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Okay , next . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yep . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh that finished ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	No no . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Components . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	No ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Components ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So , will you go to the next slide ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yes sure . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And then there are two kind of things which can be 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So we could not put that . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	and then there could be buttons , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Okay . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	So this is the easiest design the there could be . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	To have different technologies . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	So this was the 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	So these are the slight problems . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Because 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	yeah 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	the reason is that if we go into the market means 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	though I don't have much idea , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Actually I'm not so sure 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So if we go with just the 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I'm sure . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	because I'm the 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145		
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Okay so 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Well it depends if it's a remote control th 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Alright . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	We are targeting T_V_ . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	We need 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Um we have 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	With a good shape for the 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	or good shape , yes . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	We should bring new technologies for young peoples , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Maybe this is something we can stick to it . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Well it depends though well it depends . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	If we we don't 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	So that's an extra 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah that's right . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Don don't you ha 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	cost . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Well this is this is another que 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	we still haven't really defined the remote . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Are we still 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	'Cause that really makes a big difference . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . That's good point . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	It's it's not really gonna 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	What's what cou what could be the cost of uh 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	It's not possible . It's impossible . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	But but I dunno , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Uh 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	of increasing the unit price . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	What would be 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yeah 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	because 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Okay , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Wha but what would be 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	one question , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Well th 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	What what kind of information ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	They have tele teletext . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Well , because they have teletext on it . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	the n 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	They have t most of them have teletext , 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	So to to uh 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	You can get a lot more information on it . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	you could have uh o 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Okay . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	so you can quickly just kind of even without reading 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Well no , 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	but there are the electronic programme guides out there . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Are 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	There's dependi it also depends on the country . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well because 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the T_V_ . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	No 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192		
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	I dunno . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	We need to find that out . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	We need to close the meeting . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Um so 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	But just a small thing , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	what kind of market we are targeting ? 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Very quickly . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	That is very important . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	No . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Mm . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	If it's a really small T_V_ maybe . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Broke . Okay . Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Okay . Okay . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay . Okay . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So this is that we z that that we should target . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	So the com the um the uh 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	the committment is the following , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	we don't go for speech recognition technology . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	So 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah , but not sure . 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Maybe it's cheaper , 	
IS1004b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	but we have no 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	You need a internet connection . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	You need m more things . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245		
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	But 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	You just say channel fifty , and that's it . 	
IS1004b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . 	
IS1004b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,
