TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello again . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hi . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hey , Project Manager . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	I have a little problems with my laptop . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	No , a little problem , uh big problem . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I just thought 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	What was it , problem ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Um , it didn't work anymore . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	The laptop ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	The entire Windows uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	It hang hung . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	It it hung . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Ha-ha . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Oh . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Project Manager . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yes . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	You're our Project Manager . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yes . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Your project manager . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Welcome to the conceptual design meeting 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	for Real Reaction . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh , hello again . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Uh it's uh the same as the last time . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited . information . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	During lunch , yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Master . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	He's the master , yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Master of 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our from uh are of two sorts . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Components concepts and user interface concepts . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Well , we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Uh how how about the energy ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	So uh where to put what button . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And uh uh I would say uh Jans , can you begin ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah , sure . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	At the end , uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I will take notes 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Uh , let me see . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I think it's this one . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Ha . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Wow . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Right . Uh , well , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	I'll be talking about the components . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Uh below forty five and above . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Well uh what I found was that a senior um 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I'm sorry . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	senior citizens uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Ye Ah , it's it's okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . Go on . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Wood and chrome . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Well uh , shapes are curved and round . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Y y you get the picture . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Uh , so w well uh , firs 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	One one little question . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um about the the material . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yes . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh a soft material for a remote control ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	No , I'll I'll get to that . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	You you'll see . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Thank you . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	That would be actually very nice , uh I figured . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Oh . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Well , we could also use a battery , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	that's a bit 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Uh , and uh uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Well , y you could just go for a battery . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Or you can go for both ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , I actually did . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Well , sunlight preferably . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	W nah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Mm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Mm yeah . It's too less space . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	But , well you just take up all the space , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	But you prefer kinetic ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	I mean , if 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah , well uh actually it is . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	And it it 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Exactly . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Thank you , Tim . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Like slamming on it . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	It's exactly the same . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	And so that Uh Uh well , 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	it was kind of square 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	and uh I figured that's a bit boring . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So you you 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um , single curve , it's just a well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	That gives you an whole new uh effec 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Dynamic dynamic look ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	But , that uh we'll discuss later . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	But , are you going to draw it ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	What ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	The 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	You want me to draw in three-D_ ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Th th yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Uh , I c I can't imagine . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I can't imagine how how how it looks like . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Well uh let's say y uh you uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Let's say that's your standard uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Design . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	That's a bit your d standard design . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	But you could actually go like uh something like this . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So y you you just 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah , this is a this bit uh difficulty in 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I didn't take a major in art . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So But 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Oh , okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	You you don't have to use standard uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Oh , okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	A little artistic . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Uh that might be an idea , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	but just a 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	You We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	It's soft . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah , it's soft and it's that I like soft . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	That's the material the younger people want uh , ain't it ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	yeah I mean uh plastic uh is 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	like plastic uh Your your 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Uh that's maybe just me , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	but Uh , we could uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	uh , oh , talk about it later . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Uh furthermore , buttons . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And uh chip set , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So that's something we th have to keep in mind . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Well , I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah , probably . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	U usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah , probably , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	but But uh yeah , that's that's 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah , you you you should we should 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah , a combination . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	A combination , yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	A combination . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	When you pick it up , it charges up . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Like an uh aku uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Acu uh , yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah yeah , I know . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Just like the watch from Seiko . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Well , . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Psycho-kinetic . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah , I con Exactly . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	What uh what do you think ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	You agree ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah ? Both ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Combine them . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . Combine them . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	but I mean the 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Who cares , right . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	That's the Project Manager's problem . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Buy a fifty cents battery and uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Of course . Fifty cent . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah , well Fifty cent uh 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Uh , why doesn't 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	That 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	No , we'll we'll just wait and uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Uh , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Rubber . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Rubber . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh , rubber ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	You 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Or do you think it 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Uh , I figured it will be m rather than hard 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Rubber casing , yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Rather hard . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	I I I would choose rubber . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh , is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It isn't , I think , yeah ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Well , m I don't know . No . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	We're 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	That isn't 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	We put fashion in electronics , 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	so maybe we can uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Hmm ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah okay , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah , that would cover it . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	That 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	That that would solve the problem . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	That's it's custom customisable and 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	So mm Uh uh so 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	I I I prefer rubber . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , me too . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Me too . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah , you too ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	You sure ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	You you you seemed to hesitate a bit . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	That's good . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh it's not bendable or something , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I th I think that goes too far . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Oh . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	No , that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah it m might it might . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Uh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So that shouldn't be a problem . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay , well that's my uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Thank you . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Uh , you're welcome . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Can I uh do my thing ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . Do your thing , Tim . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	It uh 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Do your thing . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Bring it on . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Expert map . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Last week 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	For marketing . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Findings . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	At first , the colours of fruit . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Very basic colours , like Janus explained . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Um , considering material , um 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . They like spongy material , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Spongeball . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	like yeah a sponge-ball . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Like a s soft material . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Janus m uh mentioned it also . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	I think he did some uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	some findings himself . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Well , the Teletubbies sh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	You wer you weren't in Paris ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay . Like this . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Flashy . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	It's nice , I think . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah , uh materials like wood that 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well , you could . You you could . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	No n j just j just a w 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah but never seen one . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	It'll float . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Tables . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	The that isn't wood anyway , but 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Okay ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	But , that's our secondary audience . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	So , uh we decided to take 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	mm yeah the people below forty . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	So , that this doesn't apply . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	'Kay , the third . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	They have to look fancy . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um , they should be technological in innovative . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	That means uh there have to be fancy things in . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh , and easy to use . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	But that's common . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	My personal preferences . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um , two advantages . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh , it fits within the current market trends . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Ah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Hey . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Hey . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	That might be a next step . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	There are numbers on it , so uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah , exactly . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , like something . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	but it 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Twelve fifty uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	'Kay , second . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	No , but 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Well , yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	It's just the same . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	When you're at college . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Take it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	You take your uh remote with you to school . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Uh No . You al 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	You take your remote control with you . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	you also take uh t 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	you take your IPac and go uh play games . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Well , I do that , but 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Okay , and um 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Very nice . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Ooh . S 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	That's it . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Uh great . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	In 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay . Um the interface contents . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And uh make the menu structure changeable . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So if you press um system , that's 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Or maybe even a step further when you want to um 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	And um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Does a remote look 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	And some remotes you can use with your thumb . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	But I think that's too difficult for this one . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	And use your other hands on the menu structure . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two , three , four , et cetera . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And the the volume control and program control maybe . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	And , down here , um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So you can use it in uh in this way . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Um 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	And do not use too many levels . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	But just the um uh just in one button if possible . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	And um , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Um , channel one , two . And when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Just m most most modern T_V_s , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	And else , to one and through after that . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	So the s a button less . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Things like um um 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . Uh , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	L like in uh internet explorer . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Is uh volume plus and minus ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	And this is program uh plus 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	and minus . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah okay , but does it that is for uh going from four to five . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yes . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	But if you go from two to eight , and you want 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah , and on two . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	That you can switch switch easy . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Well yes , I think that's a good idea . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah it is . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	You just don't have to play games uh in-between . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Mm no . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Um , yeah already already told that . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	That's it . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . That's my conclusion . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Oh , okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Uh 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I don't know how you think about it . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Well , I agree , 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	just put it in the menu structure somewhere . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah but 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	What I see uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Something like that . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um , w well , yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	It it has to be fast . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , ok 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Why 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . Pu push parents . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	And if you push parents , then 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	That then 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . To log in . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	And if you puts a ye 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Like two one three . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Uh-huh . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	And it's in . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	And if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	It automatically goes Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Okay . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Well 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	I don't know what 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	because uh you Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	V violent T_V_ . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	and uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Well , maybe um some idea on that . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah , of course . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	That's a that's a better idea ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	But if you want to install it personally uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah , with and one without . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	I th Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . I don't know . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . That's true . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	will have to decide uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	That isn't possible . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	But , well , if you want to 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Hmm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	But that 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	And that uh provides parental control , for instance . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	And that's just an optional uh device . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	So there's n that's there's 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	I wouldn't put it in an optional device . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	That that then then then it becomes too much , I think . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , and 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah , on a separate menu uh option . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah , that's true . That's true , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	go to a channel . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226	but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah , yeah of course . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	But 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	But , only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Ah it's 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	So , you you'd be 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	But it's just an an added feature feature . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	I personally think that that becomes too much . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah , well yeah , I 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	And games ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	games . It doesn't 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	That that doesn't c that doesn't co 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	That would 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	but uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	So that will uh that that that must be in it , you think ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Yeah , that will be nice . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Okay . So the games uh are in it . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	The voice recognition are not . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	And the parental control are 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Optional in 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	optional ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	But how we do it ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	So we should make it too complex . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Uh , but uh will there uh uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Well 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	To put 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah , to put it in always . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	You can put on 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Mm yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Well , I don't know . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	But it would would be uh more expensive . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Oh , it's a p Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yes they are . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	I thought they were just 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , you yo 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah , you you have some T_V_s any 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	a able to receive . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Yeah , some . But 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , but most often not . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah . That is true , that is true . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	And there's just some little uh clock in the remote . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah , j just some rules . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	No , no , it's very simple . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	There uh th I h 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Yeah , yeah yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	But , on the T_V_ 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Well , that's 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Yeah , of course . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	You have to f Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah , you could you could you could go like 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah , I figured I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Or j Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Uh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Ah 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Five minutes to go . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Uh , too uh too many levels . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	And uh it must be easy to use . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	And the games are in it . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249		
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Okay . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Consensus . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Uh , little more . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Oh . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Maybe for uh Jerome . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah ? I'm listening . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Um , the views . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Like a like a moat or s or something . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Um , well 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Like at 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	User profile . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah , but you have that in the 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	You use the 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Just leave the other numbers away . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Okay . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	We take it to the other meeting , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	okay ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Okay . Go on . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	I have a little w uh little chat to do 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Ah , yeah , sure . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	and uh then we uh finish . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	A little chat . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us . 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	It's it's uh very hot at the moment , 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Marketing . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	marketing 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	or did I said management ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Management . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Oh . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Just talking about myself . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah , that's my function , to 	
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.266		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Uh W 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Okay . Go on . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh Yeah . Import export . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272		
TS3007c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	And uh another one . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Som some bench-marker . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Uh , they're a ha they're at 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273		
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	I uh couldn't uh 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	and uh it has m 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	How 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	I know a marketing name for our product . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Okay . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	R_ th R_ to the third power .

TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	R_ three . Real Reaction remote . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Oh . 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Mm-hmm ? 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Uh , logo . Yeah ? 	
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Bling .

TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics .

TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222		
TS3007c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and 	
TS3007c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	The 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yeah . 	
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it .
