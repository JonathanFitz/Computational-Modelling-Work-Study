TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Like this one . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	But uh we don't uh we don't uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	It's important . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	and then they will not use this dial as often . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	But other users who are new to this device need something like that . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	so it's easier for them 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yeah , maybe so . Yes , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	A a and the voice recognition as well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	it's 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	th maybe you could uh could uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	it's it's it's another approach , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	it's more that our um . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	It's it's quite easy . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Okay . Okay , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	good . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	And and the case is is rubber ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Yes , rubber ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	And the buttons ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Plastic or rubber . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	There are plastic or rubber . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Well , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and uh the colouring ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Uh yellow with uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	with with grey or black . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	we'll we'll come to that later . Um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Anything else to add 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	or 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	No . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Well , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	But 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	but it 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	M uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Or not ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	You 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Well 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	And a button for disabling the voice recognition . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Yeah 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	but o okay , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	that that's not really really important . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	The basic 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Okay . Um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Uh my name is not name 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	but 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	You are nameless . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Uh well , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	I used the the uh documents . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	And these uh were the most important criteria . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Is it spongy ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	It should be . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Fancy look and feel . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	So 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	So 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	just walk through it step by step . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	I mean , is it fancy , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	everything I believe uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Uh well 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I believe it's fancy . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	appar 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	I believe it's fancy too . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	No . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Oh , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	So 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	sorry . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Okay , so 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	this 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	these are the cr uh the criteria . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	I think these are the most important criteria . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Okay , well 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	So uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	that's about it . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	The production costs . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	The costs are not under Can I Um this is the 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Twenty two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yikes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Well 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	it's very expensive . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So I guess we should skip that , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	because it's not that important . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Okay . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Why does the price and and the s 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	oh , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	one uh exa 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	The number of uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Um well , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	this is what I would call our luxury model . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Um 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	And and does it 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	if you would 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	um then I did the following changes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	um by not using the voice recognition feature , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Um Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	I believe 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Uh , push-button , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	well 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	It makes it the thirteen 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	but do add extra cost . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	So um yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	th this design is not um within our price model . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	But I'm afraid it's not complete . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	And you have not added one item there . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So it's c way too expensive . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	It's still too expensive , yeah . Um 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	But that's that's only for the buttons . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So the button we can use plastic . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out , um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	oh . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	And uh maybe not use the special form . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	And the pla uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	But it 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	But it's the board decision . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Um And um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Well , b basically 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	it 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Type of m maybe another market segment . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	m 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	and uh m maximise the profits 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	and um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	That's maybe that's better . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	but that's not what uh has been asked . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	I know , I know . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	we should kick the board's 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	uh Well 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	uh by giving it another colour already . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Um so 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	It's not that innovative . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Or however you s pronounce that . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Um so , okay . Um Oh , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yeah , too bad . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	this is the wrong one . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	So uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	that means redesign . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	I guess 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um well , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	maybe it's good to do it anyway , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	We l we can learn . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . Yeah . I agree . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Well 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Is it fancy ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I d 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	it is it is 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Yay . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Is it ? Is it fancy ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Um the yellow rubber , I think so . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I think so . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	You like the rubber , uh Roo . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I'm into it . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	one ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	But it's not that fancy . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	No , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	I mean 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	I'll I'll I'll give it a two . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	It would be even more 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	You like tita 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	That's a flavour as well . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	It has flavour . Yes , that's right . You should taste it . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Right . Um 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Is it uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah , I know , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	but but it 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	It has to do with fashion , I guess . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	do 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	It's trendy trendy , fun 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	And w 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	yeah . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So in that way It it's fancy . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	It applies . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	It 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Well , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	just give it a two . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	but we decided not to , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	but that's sti that's uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	So 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	We w we do have uh the rubber , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	we do have the colours . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	That's two out of three . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	So I believe uh we are close uh to two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah , I I agree . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yes , I agree too . It's okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	We did 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	we did good . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Okay , and uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	was it innovative ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Well , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	with the voice recognition feature 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	and uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	But that's not in it . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yep . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Ov or can we 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	No , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Well , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	let's let's this product . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	And the scroll uh wheel . The solar 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	not many remotes have the solar , I think . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	No . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah , and uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	but it's it's way too 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	That would have been a thrill . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	but 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	also a uh two ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I think uh it's a two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yep . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Is it easy to use ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	I'm not sure . I'm not sure . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Well yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Well , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	hard 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	it's not for the for the e for the elderly . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Well , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	They won't use it . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	but there are two parts in this remote control . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	What you see here is is the basic part . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Everybody can use it , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	so that's easy to use . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	That's for a novice user . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	So in that in that way it is advanced , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	So uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I think I think a three . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	It's maybe it's not very uh easy for 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Wouldn't give it more . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Uh I'm doubting doubting as well . Um 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Well 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	the p 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Okay . Uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	two 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	or three ? Three ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Wha wh what would be your guess ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	It's the uh it's it's overall . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Is the device easy to use ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	After all , I think personally I would give a two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Um Okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	But 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Uh Roo , a three ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yep . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Ruud ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Good question . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Uh I'll go uh for the two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Okay . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	So that's ten . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	I could make it e easy ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	If you make it a four it will be three in general . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	So that's w 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	No , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	two and a half . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	If he makes it a four . Not a three . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Six and four . Six and four is ten . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Divided by four is two and a half . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	So 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Darn . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Nee . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Hmm ? Huh ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Roo . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	A seven , a three 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	No . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah . I yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	A four and a three together . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Four ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	you have a two , he has a two . Three ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	two , two , three 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Two ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	And a three ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	No , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	I haven't said anything yet . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	No . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Nee . I know . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Okay , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Divided by four . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	If you fill out a four 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	That's not even 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	But I'm filling in a three . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Does it will 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	so it will be a two point five . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	But that's not possible to fill in , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yes , it is . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	so we have to round it . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Is it easy to find ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I have a veto . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Exactly . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	It's not about the content , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	it's about 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	okay , um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	is it easy to f 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah , definitely . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	It it most definitely is it's very easy . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	or beeps 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	or 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Maybe 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Uh I I think I think 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	I'm here , I'm here . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	something like that . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	But even without it 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	So , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Well , I uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I th 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	but I personally give it a one . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah , me too . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Um Sebastian ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Me too . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Right , well . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	The feel of the remote control is spongy . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Well , uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	it can't be more spongy . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	it can be . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Was it one of our options ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	No , it's not one of our option , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	No . Uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	No okay , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	this this was a most spongy option . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	but when you look in the market , when you look 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	So , in the in 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	but but 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	for the options given , it's the most spongy one . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Uh yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	They're out there . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yes , but it's not good enough , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	so it's a two . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	I'll give it a one . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	I wan 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	I'll take one . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	You take one ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	What do you give it ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Well yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	it depends , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	'cause it's the most spongy we could 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah , I know , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	but you have to name a fig uh a number . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	but 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Because we need to go on in for the time . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Well , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	It will be a one . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So I'll just give it a two 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	and make this a one point five . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	No no no . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Uh I'll I'll change it , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I'll make it m 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	my my mark will be a four . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	You are 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	okay . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	The remote control offers enough features . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Well , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Ruud , what what do you think about it ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Well , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	but the voice recognition could add a lot . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	So 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Basically it's it's completely programmable . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	depends . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	So it's quite advanced . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	What what we didn't talk about is um uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	but it ha doesn't has the digits . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	I believe it's 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I think it has . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Bec because you can um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	we didn't talk about it , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	So , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Has uh the signals sent to it . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Signal . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Absolutely . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Although there are i a few buttons , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	but the inside is is quite uh advanced . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	But that that's its power , I guess , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	And this is quite s simple . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	You can use your voice to to programme it . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Yep . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	It's 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Okay , um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	let's give it a number . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I'll give a two . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah , I'll give it a one . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um I think think a one , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	so that's like um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	So high quality , low acceptance . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	D do you agree ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yes , I agree . I 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Maybe we should have a radar uh function . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	But 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	But we could couldn't uh what 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	what's the selling price ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Fifty ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Twenty five Euros . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Uh twenty five . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	And costs were twelve fifty . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	So uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	selling price uh would be uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	M about fifty Euros . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	That's quite ex 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	That's price , but w w 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	No . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	it's more than fifty Euros . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	It's quite expensive , yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Bu but well 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	yeah , I know , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	but you're paying for th for the brand , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yes . Yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	but you can you c 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yes , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	but you can learn this thing , all these functions . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	And it's easier to use 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	. 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	and this one does . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	So I think it's worth its price . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Um you had an overall rating . Um 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	but uh with these ratings uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	That's counting . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	it's it's about one point five . Something like that . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	should be about one point s seven , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Four six seven eight . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Okay . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Nine divided by six . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Okay . Um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Um What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Ruud ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Try to translate that . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Well 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Hmm . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Any any other 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Uh , Roo ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Well , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	I think uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	I think 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Ye 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Roo . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	The process was good . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	And and that was the the big deal . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Mm . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	I if we knew that before , we c we could have made 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Actually , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	we had 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	the the choice between what 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Better decision . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	We had we had too little information actually . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	So And uh um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	the the the 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Less . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	So there was not really a process of uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Well 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yes . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	The prices . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	in the first meeting we we already were very creative . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	We're tempered by that , yes . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Okay , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	No , no . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Ruud ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	I agree . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	You agree , okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Uh leadership . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Fantastic . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	I think we're a good team . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I think so too , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh . Um 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243		
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144		
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	I tried once , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	but that was not allowed . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Yeah . So um 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	but but si uh w w w 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	I think so too . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Yeah . Um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Uh . The digital pen was okay , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	but SMARTboard was really bad . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	It it's 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	Because of the response 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	or 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	The response is very slow 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Response 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	and 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	and the possibilities are very limited . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	It's not accurate . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Okay . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Uh it it has 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	its um uh where it uh 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Draws . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah , where it draws . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	It's uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Okay , so 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	So uh 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	You to take in account that your you m 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Uh yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	yeah uh 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	It's too slow 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	It is ? 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	So uh it's not the calibration , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	it's the thing itself , I think . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Hmm . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Or not at all ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	No . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Not at all . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Not really . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	I I think so too . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Yes . Yes . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yep . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	If it has O_C_R_ , uh I think uh I would use , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	It w it w 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	It was necessary for me to uh 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	To digitise them . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Yeah , 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	I type faster than I write . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	So 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Because you have everything in one place 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	and it's quite easy quite easy 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	it's it's possible to make this information digital 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	and share it with others in a quite easy way . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	I think it's a good product . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Economic . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	I know . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Yeah . Okay . Um 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	What w 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Oh , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I only use it to draw a rabbit , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	so can't say much about it . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174		
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	or 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Yes . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	No , 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	or the other way around . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	Or the other way around , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	that you could show but m 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Yes , yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	That's quite what PowerPoint does . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	But y you can 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	I know . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	I know , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	but 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	So it's almost 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	I know , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	but we couldn't use that feature , 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	so I missed it . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yep . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	We weren't able to do that . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Mm-hmm . . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	An object , yes . Yes . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	I it's not possible 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	yeah . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Okay . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	So it's 	
TS3011d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Oh it looks like paint actually . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Okay , so 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	y it 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	it's not even as advanced as paint . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Not not uh n not way . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Yeah . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	It's quite uh limited . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	Okay . 	
TS3011d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Uh no . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279		
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115

TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Well , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . 	
TS3011d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	And no added value . At all . 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	No , 	
TS3011d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .
