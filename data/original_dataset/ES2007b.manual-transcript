ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Right it was function F_ eight or something . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	This one right there . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Tha 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Think we all 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Huh . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	You will as well ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Oh I thought we all were . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah , I have one too , okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	S 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yep . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	. 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Whoops 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I forgot to put the thing on 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Right . I just wanna 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay I'm 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	just gonna leave this up here 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	'cause I'll you know . So 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I'm Catherine with a C_ . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay ,

ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Right . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	True . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Uh , right . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I am your Project Manager , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and , uh yeah , I'm just here to 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	sort of liaise between the three of you 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	and get things going , get people talking 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	what you've been working on for the last wee while , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	So we're gonna 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . Um . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	How long is the meeting ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	No problem . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	it it just it just says that you it's 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	that's just one particular medium . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	you can talk to us , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	'Cause I don't . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh okay . So um . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	You okay over there ? Reissa , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I'm fine . Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I uh yeah , yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Think she's finishing up her presentation . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	No no . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Uh I'm done . Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay , jolly good . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Alright , let's have um 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So that's gonna be you Catherine , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	if we wanna hear from you first . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um just connecting this . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Are we getting i 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	You don't have to worry about screwing it in just 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Really ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . Cool . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	there you go . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . So I've got a very quick uh 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Uh . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	so um I've 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	oh no , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	you can't see a thing . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Oh well , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I'm gonna draw it on the board then . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Oh . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	We it's fine on my screen , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Ah . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	but never mind . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So um the idea is that we've got the 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	energy source um , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	which in our case will pr , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	oh well okay , never mind . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	So um I think maybe uh two batteries , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I dunno what they're called 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	six , or something like that . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Uh and then 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	um 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	which could be uh an infra-red signal , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	um which will be sent by an electronic chip . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um and that's it really for the working design . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Great . Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Sorry 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	the presentation wasn't very uh clear but 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Really ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Cool . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Um , should I erase this or 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Do you wanna just give us a moment , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I just wanna copy this down . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Fine . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Or suggestions ? 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Is a battery like the only way of 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah , you blow on it and i 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	No , no 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	In indoors . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	No I meant like 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Bicycle power . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	The battery's down and 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	maybe , I dunno , solar charged ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I dunno , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	it's worked for the last fifty years you know . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	One question I have , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	How far away is your television ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Uh 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Well , the thing is uh you you don't 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	does it ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	That's true . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	I didn't think about that 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	How about Bluetooth ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	but 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Why not ? 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Isn't that a better signal ? 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I just think that it's it's gonna cost more 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	You know we don't need it . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	but then I don't th I dunno , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	you are gonna 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , exactly . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	But 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	It's uh 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	'S just an idea . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Right , well done , Catherine . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Do you need the border ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Sorry . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Technical . Okay . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Adjusting . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay , so , while this is warming up , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	there it is uh . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So I'm doing the user interface design . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	um so up-down keys for that , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	uh channel keys up-down , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and uh a mute button . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh , I don't I dunno , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	uh that's one possibility . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	but I can show you uh . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	so you see it's rather busy , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Uh and this is a user centred one . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Great . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	And I 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	but it can be a little bit overwhelming , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	. 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So uh , yeah , that's me . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Great . Okay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	That was sort of the inspiration for it . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I dunno , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Um 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I would say it's If it's simple to do , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	which I think it probably should be , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	'Kay . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Right . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	but you know being physical . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Look into . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Mm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Right . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	We put the fashion in electronics . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Mm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I think I think we have to carry that mental . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	There you go . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Mm . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Well yeah 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	these , I think , we can 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	so we talked about the layout in my presentation 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Because we need 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . Great . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and keyboards 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay , fantastic . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Right , well done , Gabriel . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	. 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Where does it go into ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	. 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Here ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	The blue thing . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Uh , yeah , this is getting all . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	. 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Well , function F_ eight . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	No 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah , it just takes a second uh . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	oh . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Come on . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Right . Okay . . Okay . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	and also gave 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	so this is research 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So I think we all agree with that . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	So , they don't like like the way they operate 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	it doesn't like match how people behave . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	they only use the up and down channel . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	'Cause we've only got five channels . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	exactly . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	That's another thing . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	I think especially for uh the older generation . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	takes ages to work how to use . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Anyway um 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um personal preferences . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Wow . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	You are a child of technology , aren't you ? 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Um so yeah um 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And it's easy to find , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	so I don't know whether maybe 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	So voice activation . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	So and this was what we came up with . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Then if you look fifteen to twenty five 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	this is age , sorry , age groups . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	So there you go , yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Um 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	And neither did the older generation , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	They they don't . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Um but no they're not sort of 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah , that would be my guess as well . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	So they don't 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Um d and tha 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Well 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	and that's a that's quite a minority there , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	These guys are growing up . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I mean , okay , there's 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Voice activation might not be the best . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Uh . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	so wrist sense 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Repetitive strain uh 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Huh ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	rep repetitive strain injury 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , repetitive strains injury , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	or like from doing 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	so they don't 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I don't think so . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	So y so it's so it's so you got 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	maybe not so hard . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	see 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Let's jus 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Maybe 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	or we just like flat buttons , something . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Okay . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	So that is me . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	That's great , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	thank you very much for that , Reissa . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Um okay , so we've basically 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	we've decide we've d 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	It's gotta be safe to use , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	it's gotta look cool . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	It's gotta be cheap . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	S um . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	uh and that would be infra-red , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	energy source , that would be batteries . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	But a in there's no 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yep . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Um 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	anyone have any questions ?

ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Now this is good , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	we've got a good structure going on . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	We all know where we're going to . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Have you been ge has 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?

ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Well , just questionnaires .

ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	You want to have friends , don't you ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	yeah , okay . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	but I might be just going a bit 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Okay . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Well , 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	It wouldn't be 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Can't we have different colours in the remotes , 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	so somebody can choose different col 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	like does it have to be of a certain ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	It's gotta say 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	like if it had a symbol on it . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Mm . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Whoa . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	So we have to have it one colour . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Well you could 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Mm . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	It's got to 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	It could come 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Mm . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	If . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Quite poss yeah . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Well this is all your department . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Mm okay . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	. 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Well , well done everybody . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , pretty soon I think , 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I guess that's now . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	We might possibly have done . 	
ES2007b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Cool . 	
ES2007b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Alright , see you all soon . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . 	
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150		
ES2007b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	'Kay uh . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah , there you go . 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Right . I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but 	
ES2007b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .
