ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um welcome to our second meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	This is the functional design meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	And I hope you all had a good individual working time . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay , let's get started . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	And then we're gonna close up the meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	First we need to determine the user requirements 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	that's the whole technical side of 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Oh , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	well let's go ahead and , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	back , previous . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Who would like to start us off ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I don't mind going first . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	it's in the should be in the m Project . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	You know you could you could do it yourself actually . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Oh . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Did you send it ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Save it in the project documents . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Put it in Project Documents , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm-mm-mm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	This one ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Sure . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . Great . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um well , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	the channel going up and down , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	These are two examples . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Ready . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	And what functions it needs to complete . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So that's it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Very good presentation . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Thank you . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	You speak with such authority on the matter . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Mm . Left . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Who would like to um follow that one up ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Now , that we've discussed 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I can go . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Do you want me to run it or you wanna 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah , you should run it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Functional requirements . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mm yes . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yes , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Seventy five percent think they're ugly . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	and basically w we just need something that really 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I mean there's some other points up there , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So that's really what we need to do . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Wait . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And that meaning what ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Like 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	They like I guess use the buttons a lot . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I don't know . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	It's from my uh research . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Right . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay , what do you m 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	My team wasn't very clear . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Only use ten percent of the buttons . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Oh , I'm sorry . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	That's okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I I think it's like the engineering versus user , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Oh , right . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	The buttons . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	We only use ten per cent of our brains . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Good point . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	It works . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	It's a necessary evil . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Ready for the next slide ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	And so people say that they typically lose it , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	much like any small appliance like a cellphone , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Lost . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and they 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	we need something simple , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and we don't want to go 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	S 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	It's okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	It's very important . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yes , it is important for the remote control world . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Wait , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	is that like your 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Sh 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Could be , yeah . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Uh possibly . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Like 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Oh . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Channel , volume , power . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	don't know . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I think that's a pretty good guess though . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah , I would assume so . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	It's like if you're holding it 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . It's okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	but those are the definitely the top ones . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Next slide ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yes . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	but it it really needs to be simple . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	User-friendly . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	as well as the age range . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	they really 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	consumers are really interested in it , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	And so just to 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I guess so , yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oh , that'd be lovely . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	You know like go to the base . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	We could definitely include that if we wanted to . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	If it's within our price . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I'm just trying to move it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Working design . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	There we go . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Oh my bad . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Oh that's fine . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Help me . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	What exactly is a smart chip ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I wouldn't think so , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Ready ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um yep , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	nothing here . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	That's okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Um power source , I figured , batteries , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'cause they're easily available . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um a large on-off button , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	so a large on-off button would probably be good . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	and that's kinda it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh this is my fifty second design . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Power source over here . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	This is just like a rough schematic . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So this would be the front ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So this is the internal workings . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Oh okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	The l the light up kind of 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Like that we know the battery's working . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	It'd probably be lighting up the key too , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	We can skip that whole thing . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	right ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yep . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So you can put it in the dark . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	The buttons . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah , and that's good . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	We should make it glow in the dark . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , definitely . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	'Kay nex R Ready ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah , that's it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	'Kay , any p 'Kay ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I think that that's a good idea , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Anything else ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	because you know that's one of the most important buttons . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Just 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Well , should it be larger buttons in general , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	I think we should . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	sorry , um . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	'cause most remotes have small square buttons , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Mm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Ovals . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay , let's talk about all of our 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	let's um wrap up this one , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Wait , come back . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Sorry , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	let's go through this . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Here we go . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	New product requirements . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	We're trying not to over-complicate things . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It's not gonna be multi-functional . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Hey . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	And we th need to promote our company more , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	We're trying to get our name out there in the world . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	And you know what teletext is ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	in States we don't have it , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I know . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	What is it ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	it's very um bland looking , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	it's just text on the screen , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	it's like black , black and white kind of 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	not even 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	just black with just text . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Like running along the bottom ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	It'll give you the sports . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Wait , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Kind of . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Except the entire screen . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	It's the entire screen is just running information at random . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah it's the whole screen . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	So anyway 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Seemingly . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	you know it's like 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Right . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Those are our new product requirements . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Alright . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yes . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	It's part of the logo . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Company colour being yellow . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	and just definite things that we need to do 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	and then we'll close up the meeting . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So . Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Whatever . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	So our target group is 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	You mentioned um older people ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	It's gonna make it nicer . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	I mean they want something user-friendly , so 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	all um , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	not kids obviously , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	right ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Or kids ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	No , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Okay , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah , I think we need it all . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Um what about 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	technic technical um specifications , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	We should go for the lowest denominator . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Right , okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	High school educated . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So so they need no technical experience to operate 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	how 'bout little to no , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	just to get it all out on paper . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Mm-hmm , volume . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	And channel . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Those are the most important ones . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Right . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	And we wanna keep um 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Correct , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	because people only use ten percent . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Hey , what else ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Um . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Um . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111		
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	I think so . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	What do you 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Sure , yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112		
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	A finding kind of device or 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	And 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I need 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	we we need a like homing device . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah , ho homing device . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Oh right 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	yeah okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Tracking . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Right . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	What if we gave it a charger ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	But you got a base . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Do you think people'll really go for that though ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Because 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	It's useful for the remote phone . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	I I think we can make a decision about that later . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	So that would include battery source 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Power source rather . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Right . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Do w 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Well , then we could 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Mm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I don't know if you guys ge 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	You could um 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	we could hook it up . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Oh . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So basically older people don't really care . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Well 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	just sitcoms and stuff . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Right . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	So 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Right . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	A certain phrase then it could beep . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	I dunno . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Just throwing it out there . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Well 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124		
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Still fifteen minutes . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Um . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Can we conceive of leaving them out ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Um . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Wait , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	on the remote itself ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Well , we definitely need those . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	How how , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	yeah , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	how would you leave those out ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Well , I don't know , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	I mean , if you can like well 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I don't know , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Unless you could say the channel . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	if there's just a way of leaving them out ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I think people would find that too foreign . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah , that's true . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	You definitely need 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	It's when we get satellite . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Mm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	get your own remote , or digital cable . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	'Kay . Um . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	The colour being yellow ? 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Wait . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	I'm guessing . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	And how do we 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	And the R_R_ . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	R_ the double R_ . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	We could just have the logo in yellow , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Can't make it entirely 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	or maybe a yellow light for the keys . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Or is the l 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Or put like stripes , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	oh yeah , yellow lights . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah , 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	yellow could be and it could 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	doesn't have to be huge . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Well if you have like a 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Hang on . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Right . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Right , yeah . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	or no menu buttons . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Um can we go back to 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	I'm gonna look really quickly back at those 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Two examples . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	examples 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	and see if there is anything . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Which one is yours , technical functions 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Oh , it's a 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	or functional requirement ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Okay . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	The T_V_ . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Hmm . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	and so it's like 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Couldn't we do that all through one button , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I don't well , I don't know . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	you know ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Right . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Well , that could be 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	For the menus . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	No 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	That's true . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Channel is just up and down . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	And then add a 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Something that looks mayb you know . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Y right , right right right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	That one ? 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Right . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	In the middle perhaps . 	
ES2010b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	included in the menu . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Yep . 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Ooh , 	
ES2010b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I just got an idea for a design . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	good . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? 	
ES2010b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I had something , but I forgot . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Okay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	get out of here . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Alright . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	And then we're gonna have lunch break . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Um I'm gonna put the minutes 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	if you'd like to review them . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Um here's what we're each going to do . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	and you're going to do some trend watching . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	'Kay . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	No ? 	
ES2010b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay , well , this meeting is officially over .
