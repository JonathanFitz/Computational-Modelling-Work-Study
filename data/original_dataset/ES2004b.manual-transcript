ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Help . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	It's up there ? That screen's black . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Oh God . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Are we done ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Right , okay um , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	this is our second meeting 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	and I might be a bit all over the place . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Um , right our agenda for today , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	do you want us to give you a second ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Uh , no that's okay , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	sorry . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Okay , um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	I'll go over what we decided last meeting , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	um , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Sorry . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um , our budget would have to affect um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Um want it to look uncluttered , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	undaunting to the customer . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	We discussed a flip-open design , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	um reducing the size of the control 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Okay . Um , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	three presentations , I've got written here so 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	shall we hear from Marketing first ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	I just want to get access to a little bit more information , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	No that's fine , that's fine . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	is that okay ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Okay , yeah I'll go first . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Can I grab the 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Unplug me . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Thanks . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	What do I have to press ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Oh , F_ eight ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Um , F_N_ function F_ eight . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Oh right , yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Okay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Maybe 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yep . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yep there we go . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Okay this is uh the working design , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	and try and take some inspiration from that . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	because I'm dealing with the inside really . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	and , you don't need to send very much information . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	but those can be quite bulky 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Could I can I interject to ask a question there , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Yeah sure . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	is that appropriate ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Um no no , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	and that's because of the size of the batteries , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Right , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Yeah 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	the the 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	They are . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Oh I see . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	but I'm just wondering about power consumption 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and how much you need to send the data across . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Okay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Um , now the ones at the moment are small 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	It's not a proper circuit , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	I'm not sure if it'd work or not , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	And then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	so that that should be good . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	we were talking about it before 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	and also just something that I was thinking about , uh 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	I th that was just sort of a general point there . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	And that's uh yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	That's a very important part , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Alright okay , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	so if you wanna 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Okay , thank you very much . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Um , would you like to continue on from that ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Yep . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Ooh . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	'Kay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Or , maybe move the laptop over . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	It can be 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	okay , that's okay with me . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	further . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36		
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Oops . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Why's it not working ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	F_ eight , right ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	F_ function . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Function F_ eight yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Okay . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Mm why's it in the right ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	No . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Yeah , it's connecting . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	No , no 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	yeah it's just . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Meter adjusting . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Oh , there . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	because um , I haven't had some marketing data 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	and basically every product is marketable . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	to make make it as simple as possible . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	will this two features together . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	As we saw we we have to make a profit also 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	mm by fifty million we said ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Um , that's so this is 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Uh any comments like , if you want ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	'Kay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	'Kay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Yeah sure . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Oh , God . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Right , okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Have I got to keep this here ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	I think you'll have to 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	You can't 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Does it matter ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	It'll have to 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	this can't be pulled . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	We just do the best we can . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Uh , whoops . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	You'll have to push it a bit more . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Will it manage ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Bit more , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	oh dear . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yep . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah this is more than enough . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	There we go , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Okay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	I've got a bit more of the cable . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Oh . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	There we go . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Is that okay ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	I think you can pull it out now . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Thank you , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	just pull it closer a little bit . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Uh you should be able to and 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Yeah , you might . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Get it right over , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	yeah , there you go . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	okay , thank you . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Ah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Look at that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Okay , um , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Um , so that's where we started , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	male and female , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	all age groups from fifteen upwards 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	and um we observed them in the lab , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	just their general use of the remote control , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	you can see we had a hundred subjects there . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Our findings , lots of findings , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	I've just summarised some of them here . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	so it has obvious design implications there . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	we were quite surprised by that finding , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	So again there's power implications there . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	so again a big design issue there . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	and in the older age group it kind of reverses , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	they're not so bothered with this . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	'Kay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	but I think I'll just keep it simple , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	if there's any more information I can email you extra details , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Okay . Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	That's fine . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	is that okay ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Right , um 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Huh . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	we have new project requirements , um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	we're not going to be using teletext , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	our control is only going to be for T_V_ , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	it's not going to be a combined control , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	which limits you know all of the different things that 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	it limits the cost for us , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Mm-hmm , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	It says for T_V_ only , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	so looks like it's just 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Just channel-hopping . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	yeah , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	I don't know , what do you think ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	It just said , for T_V_ only . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Would that imply video use ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	T yeah yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah . If yeah 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Mm-hmm , yes . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yes . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Um we didn't really look into that 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Ten perc 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Pens 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	and they're not that great anyway . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	In fact I've just called up that table there , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Alright , okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	we asked those two questions , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Alright , okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	I think that's just general fear of new technology . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	bu 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Oh yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Right . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	so I thought that could be quite a 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	um because it is something I 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	you were saying whistling , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yes . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	That's a super idea . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Um so we want logo , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	we want um fashionable , trendy , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Um , we need to focus on that as well . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yes , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	you get the idea . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	It's it's gonna vary around the world . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Sure . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Alright . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Just 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	So 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	What about 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	you were talking about the buttons , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	'Kay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah , yeah that's what I was just yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	yeah ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	which shouldn't wear out as much either , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	not sure about the 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	No , well no 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	You don't have to press it , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	you just have to put your thumb onto it . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Um , think that might appeal 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	I'm thinking kind of Japan , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	I'm thinking uh young , um office people , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Mm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	trendy kind of a thing . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm-hmm , mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	uh there's sort of physically different things 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	because people in Japan wouldn't buy it 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	because the controller was physically to big 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Were too big . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	so they couldn't get round the controller 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Yeah , uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	So , a bigger b 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	I think we have to design one product 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Huh . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	It's gonna be the same , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	so we need to focus on just one thing , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	I'm concerned , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	this may have to be postponed to a future meeting 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	but it's something we should think about . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	and it becomes 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Or a speech recognition , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Yeah , speech recognition , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	which is extremely expensive , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	but 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yes . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	We could focus on the biggest market . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Ge uh 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	We are 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	That they want um it to be fashionable , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	they want it to be trendy 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	they have a greater population than us young people , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	but I don't think we're focusing on that , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155	and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Okay , so the remote control functions . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Um we've got the T_V_ , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	we've got the video , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Video plus . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	yes . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	is that 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	because you've got your general record anyway 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Just whack in the number . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	and it's just a number , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	it's not a date , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	it's not a time , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	it's not a channel , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	it's not when it finishes , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	it's not anything like that , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	And you w 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	it's just a number . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	you just need one 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	No . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Right , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	I've not come across that function 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	but it sounds wonderful . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	It is 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	after um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	It's not 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	and that's the number you put in 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Ah , hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	so you don't have to worry about dates 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	and you don't have to worry about times , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	um and it has been around for quite a long time . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	It's been been around for a long time 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	No it's not 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Superb . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Yes . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Right . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Excellent , mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	So that yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	But just to have that function would be would be really good . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Okay so 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169		
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Mm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.175	and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Alright . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Yes 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98		
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177		
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	but I mean for if there were any more 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	we're not gonna put any 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Yeah , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	I think so . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179	I mean 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	okay , just a thought . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Um 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Instruction manuals . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	But I mean they're there's customer service , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Department , yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Sure . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	and that way there's no call out charge , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	there's no extra , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Right . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Not for such simple functions 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.184	And they're 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	yeah , they should be f yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.193	because we're focusing on that , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Mm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.194	yes okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Simple . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Mm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188	It's the uh 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	It does , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.189	yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	and then you try and search through it , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	so that should be something we think about . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Sure , okay . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Um , what other functions ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	We need 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	but we should think about c 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	'cause you've got the dilemma between 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	but they come with a charger , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.192	I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Well they la they they last quite a long time , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	and if you had uh when you 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Yeah 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.198	and if 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.199	yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Yeah 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	it could be on that 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Yeah on that as well so . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	yeah , okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	S 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Yeah 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.202	some sort of docking station or 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Yes . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Rechargeable with a docking station . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.203	yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	So the rechargeable which would be your field . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Okay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.206	and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yes , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	which it is cheaper in the long run as well . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Um , th the shape you got trendy . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	I don't wanna big box with lots of things , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.201	And we don't w 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.202	I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.203	these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	They do . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.204	We definitely 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.205	an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.206	we don't want that . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Okay so we've got a flip-screen . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Um 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	That's very strenuous 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	because your thumb is slightly up , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Slightly curved , curved . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Okay . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	y yeah 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Okay . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Can you look into the company logo ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.221	Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Current . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.222	I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.223	um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.211		
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.224	while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	We could look in at that 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.212	I mean look at the mobile . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	but Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	logo could become as 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.213	I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.214	I've not come across anything like that before , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	A sea shell ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.215	if it kind of 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.216	yeah 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.217	and that opens out into your flip-top . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Then it's nice t to h 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.219	you can make it lightweight plastic , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.220	nice to hold in the palm of the hand 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.221	and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.222	I think it's a really nice idea 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah we could look in at that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.223	and plus you can get 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.224	you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.226	we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Mm . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.227	You could have different kind of casings . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.228	So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Less chance of it being lost too , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.231	it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.232	and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.233	they don't not gonna lose it so much either . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.234	It's easier to bit nice to handle . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Mm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Okay . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	that could be the most common design . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Okay . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	But we can like think of five , six designs . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Right , I think we have to round it up , um 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Sure . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.238	So it's no teletext , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.239	it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.240	our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.242	um something about Videoplus . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.236	That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Right . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Right . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.245	Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.246	So that they have a look at the guide and 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.248	is this just that was an add-on feature ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.237	It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Uh-huh . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Right . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Um it could be it c 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.239	It 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.240	yes , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.252	Right . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.241	it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.242	you know , drawing attention to that . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.243	And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.244	'cause it's very simple 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.245	so putting it down in words should be helpful . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.253	Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Um 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.248	We've got the buttons 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.249	but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.256	That's not at the moment a requirement , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.257	it's something we're looking at , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yes . Yes . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.258	what preference 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.259	so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.251	And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	For detection , right . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Yeah . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.252	Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.253	But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.254	so it should be fine 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.255	and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.256	I think 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Yep , 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yep , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.258	and different from what's out there . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	I think 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.260	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.259	Yep , I think that's us . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.261	What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	True . 	
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.260	I think you might get guidance , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.261	but um 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.262	I th 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Instruction manuals , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.264	'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.265	u um , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.266	but no one really uses them . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.267	Um . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Whoops , questionnaire four . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Oops . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	We should f 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.268	Yes , right . Okay . 	
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.266	'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . 	
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	I think it's time for us to get back to 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Right , okay . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.270	I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . 	
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Um and I'll be able to not answer them .
