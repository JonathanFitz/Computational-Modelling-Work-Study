ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Um almost , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	there's one more thing I have to get out of the 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I have to make sure that this attachment will open . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I keep forgetting whether I've done this . . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Ah-ha . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	We'll open that when the time is right . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	In the meantime 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Closing things down , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Let's see what this thing does . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Ah , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	we came up together , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	we're good . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Are we ready to start ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	It's now quarter of four . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	This is a f another forty minute one 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	so it will end at four twenty five . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Okay . Right . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	for us to go over the previous minutes , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	then for the two of you to present your prototype 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	We then have a finance aspect , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	So we're going to make a very fast track . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . Um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	So the first thing I have to do is close this 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	so that I can get to 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Where is it ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36		
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Red . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I need to open mine . Not the agenda . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Agenda three . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	No 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	that th 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	I want the minutes from the previous minutes . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Mm . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	That should be there , minutes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Okay . Uh 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	from meeting three , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Okay , um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	we reviewed the previous minutes before that , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	um each of you made your presentations . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Um we decided chip on print would be used . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	powered by kinetic energy . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Um looking like a scroll , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	that is uh behind the scenes is push button 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	that could be suggested to management . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	and we ran out of time . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Um we had to follow that up 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	and prepare for the last one . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	And uh we closed 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	as it ran out of time . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Yes . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Yep . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Okay , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	back to this meeting . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Um we're down to the prototype presentation . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Ta-da . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Alright . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Over to you . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Right . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Well . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Ooh , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	two . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	well you see , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	each made one , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	we didn't have enough yellow dough . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Ah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	This is the one that I made . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Uh-huh . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	This is like a scroll , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	but they are push buttons 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and they enter takes you into the different menus . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	I mean this is the infrared thing 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	that's gonna zap at the television . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	but I'm sure it will work . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Uh this is on off switch , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	'cause I think we do need that , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	and I think it gives it a nice balance . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	'Kay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Okay . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Um as for what it's actually made of 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	well 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Okay . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	lack of uh buttons all over the place . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Right ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	makes it feel nice to hold . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	but I think we have two different options , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	because we did make a another one , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	which wa uh is in the shape of banana , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	it's just 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	which is also nice 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and easy to hold 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	and feels good 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	just a slightly different design . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Also with on off switch and infrared 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	So like uh well , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I dunno , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	what's it like ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	or mix and match , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	just we were gonna see what you thought , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	the 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	So 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	And what we 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	well , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Can I scroll down on there and see what else 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Well 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	because that's the company colours , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	So , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	it just depends what you think about these ideas 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	and if I'm 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um well 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	I don't have very much to add . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um the the case 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	oops , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	but it can be either of those . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	We have the technology to do that . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	We have simple rubber push buttons 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	um which provide all the functionality we need . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	it's the stalk of the banana , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	or it's just the thing at the end of this version . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Um so 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	that's for material . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	I think that's all we've got to say really . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	This one has n 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	A banana . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	banana , yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	This one has no obvious connections to fruit , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	but because it's round and molded , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	it's more like 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	which I quite like that sort of image . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	and 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Hold them , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	you see , you know . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Curvature , is it to your liking ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Yes , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	And then you can use your thumb . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	And it was partly we thought the design looked better , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Breaking , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	you know 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	oh right . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Well you see , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	because then it'd just be rigid . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	It's really kind of a 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah , we really like we really like that design , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Like a c like a compass point , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	you know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	just up , down , left and right , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	and we think we could make that quite a good feature . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	But it's also like texting , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	you don't 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah . Yeah , yeah , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	I mean it 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	I was try 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35		
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	And it's a very simple design , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	It's texting . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	there's not a lot to wrong , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	the components are cheap to make . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	You know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	I I d I have several four remotes , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and they all look the same until you get up close 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	and you have to 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	you know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	this is really identifiable . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	The next item is evaluation . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	No , okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Uh if that's 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	if you're finished . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Uh yeah , we're finished . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	shall I take your uh power ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Oh sorry . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Oh . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Try again . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	So , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and I've made a list of criteria to look at , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	so 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	one true seven false 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	and I'm gonna now use the um the board . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Okay . So um 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	because these are things that um have been brought up , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	some of them seem rather close , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	like they overlap . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Mm , yeah , price . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	We'll put price up at the top . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Not that we actually know anything about it , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	but we can we can pretend . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Well 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	we will soon , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	unfortunately . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Um Okay , so 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Come on . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Did you say ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	No , . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Uh okay , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	so 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	and which 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	I'd call these quite uh minimalist , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yes , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	a plain , simple , clean design . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	simple and plain , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	but I mean I do see what 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	so in that respect it is quite fancy . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	I 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	yeah , so 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	in that respect 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I think we'll go with that respect . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I'd say maybe aesthetic . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Well 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	we have got s trendy further down , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Elegant . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	but 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Elegant . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Elegant . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	no 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	these aren't the exact terms that the um 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	like stylish or aesthetic . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Stylish , yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	although the the the people , the word on the street is is 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Fancy . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	N that um 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Did you just break the pen ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	yeah 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108		
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	uh the uh is fancy . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	So 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	let's let's take it to the next level . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Well 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	d 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	we'll just call it fancy then . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Well okay , so 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Should we go with the yellow 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	in terms of 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I think that's a really superior 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	I think we n we need to 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	they're both 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	they're both yellow with black buttons , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Mm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	that isn't 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	that is more curved , like a banana , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	As a banana . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	so . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	but I I do like the chunk . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	The chunk . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	So 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	No , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	is it . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but I mean in terms 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	we have to evaluate one of them . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	I'd 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	It's more true than false , about a two . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	So 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	we say true . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	technologically innovative . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147		
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	So 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	we'll say we'll say uh false . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Easy to use . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Very . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yes . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	One , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	is that inappropriate ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Oh , pardon me . Um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Trendy . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Oh yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Well , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	maybe only a two or a three then , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	'cause it's no 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	I think 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Okay , so 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	but 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	two ? Um 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Excess buttons . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	are there excess buttons ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	No . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	No . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	No . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	That is false . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	So that's false . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	True . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Ugly . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	No . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	No . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	No . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	People don't respond well to ugly . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Sellable , uh quirky , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	you know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	something people 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I think they're different , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	like 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	oh , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Well 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	it is quite it is quite quirky I think . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	aren't they ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	I like it . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	yeah . Yeah , I do too . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Oh yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	And I was I was thinking of other things 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	um in terms of 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	uh could we say it's cost saving ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	With the 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Oh , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	we also need tho think about the energy . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Is it the kinetic energy ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , with the energy . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	If it's 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Mm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	It is going to be kinetic ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Uh so 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	yes . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	so we're not completely sure about that , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Well 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	you're still in the Play-Doh stage . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	but 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Anything else ? Including price , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	do you have any idea about price or other features ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Well 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yes , the instinct says true . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	So true one 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	or should I go to two or three ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I'd put it at one I think , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	but 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Okay . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I dunno , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	I would say maybe a two , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	what do you 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah , true , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	it might be the 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	that's not a cheap thing to get . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	yeah , yeah , true . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	True . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	whereas this one has only got the four buttons 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Hmm . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Yeah , that's a good point . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	uh we need somebody to develop that . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	so then I'm gonna 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	and then make that true , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	so that 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	'cause I have to do an average . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Right . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	And then um excess buttons . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Just putting no excess buttons . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Exactly . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Wow we're doing really well . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	be 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	you know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	so it doesn't ruin the polarity . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	As for 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Or L_C_D_ . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Well 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	if you g uh 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	If not I'll average those . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	I think we're good . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Mm . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	So 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	We're a little over halfway through the meeting 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	and the next big thing is the finance . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Okay . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Um okay , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	how about if I uh pass this back to you 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yep . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	and I'll uh figure out the average here . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Right . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Thank you for everyone's help with that . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Right . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	And as you can see it says the same thing , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	it had not lost itself , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	thank Goodness . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	that they provided to me . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Um and 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Okay . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Well , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	just kinetic then , . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Um what's a hand dynamo ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	It's the wind-up . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164		
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Oh 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	shoot , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	forget that . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Kinetic is um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	and how many of those will we need per 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Just one . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	we only need one . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Okay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Just checking that . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah , simple , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	'cause we've just got push buttons , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	so we can do it all with simple 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	which is the ch should be the cheapest . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Okay , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	and we only need one of those . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yep . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Okay , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	It looks like it single curve , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	'cause of th the chunkiness . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	It's 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , that that one is single curve , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	that's uh uh one . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	isn't it ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Um do we have 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	What does double curved mean , I don't understand . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	And that's 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	I I think you it means you reverse the curve . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	uh that's the the one that goes like this . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Oh 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	no , we don't need that . No . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Right . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	you can do a banana in single curve , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Single-curved , I'd say . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	No , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	single curve . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Okay , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	I 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	I just wanna say plastic . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	We had the special colour . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	And did we say plastic ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	can we do some what ifs , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	'cause it may 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	One , two , three , four , five , six . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	but it depends on the cost , I guess . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	at the moment , that's where we are . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	It's just button . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	isn't it ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yep . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Do we need to say how many buttons , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	or 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Whoops , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	don't want that , not yet . Um 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	or d is it just one ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	No , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	it just says push button interface . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	'Kay . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Uh they'll be rubber , yep . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	So we need one of them . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	And are they any special form ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Well 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	yeah , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	like the compass point one . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Actually , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	'Cause I think they can be plastic . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah . They could be plastic , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	we don't have to have rubber buttons , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	because we haven't got a double curved case . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Oh . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Yeah , they could be plastic . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Okay . Um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	It's just one , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	isn't it ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Uh we only need one of them . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	What , we're in . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	We're in . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	That's us . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	More profit . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Great . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Okay , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	I'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	There we are . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	That's the only Excel document that will be in there , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	so it's there for all of us . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Okay , so , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	are they under twelve fifty ? 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yes , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	go to the project evaluation , next slide . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Right . Um 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	leadership , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Sure . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	teamwork , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	And Play-Doh . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Uh-huh . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211		
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah well , 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yep . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Okay . So , 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	we went over all those things 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	and we're satisfied with all the above . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yep . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Um did we find any new ideas ? 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Spongy . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	I I only speak for myself though . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	so . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Good work as a design team , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	because we 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	So 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	we actually worked well as a group . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	I thought so . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Right . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Are the costs within the budget ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Oh yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yes . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Yes . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Is the project evaluated ? 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yes . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yes . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yes . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I can give you a number , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Oh 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	hang on , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	we haven't heard . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	um it's uh 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Uh-huh . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	so it means w 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	you know , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	I can I can spell it out . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	There were six true or ones , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	four 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	um pardon me , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	two s almost true or close to true , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	so that was four points , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	and then uh one false , seven points , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	To maintain old technology , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	exactly . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Absolutely , 	
ES2013d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	and it's kept us within budget . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	so . 	
ES2013d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yes . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	So we do count as I think excellent or one . 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Alright . 	
ES2013d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	. 	
ES2013d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary ,
