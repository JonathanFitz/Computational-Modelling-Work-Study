IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Well hi everyone again . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	and so here we go . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Designer . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Should be child friendly design with few buttons , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	And she was challenged on that point 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	that's right . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and if possible a rechargeable battery . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh and of course a circuit board . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	She feels that's really what people want today . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	should be trendy design , compact and strong , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and should have buttons . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Just the look like , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	the button part I'll explain . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Uh so this is our what uh we have made . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	um and it's 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	it's blue in colour 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh and also compact in shape . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Mm-hmm . Good . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	oops , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	sorry . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	You used to have all the buttons 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um yeah and um uh 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	and uh w which which is s strong 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	um uh and also uh for the 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	um and als 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Oh that's good , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	no , that's nice and friendly . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Mm-hmm . Mm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Mm-hmm , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	And then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	And 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Now the um 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	we decided upon including certain features on our remote . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah , okay , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm-hmm , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Now we have included another feature that is the mute button 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	on the side of the model . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Then we have included one to nine buttons 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	for controlling the programmes the different channels . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	What kind of button ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Menu button . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Menu ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Uh menu th menu , uh one one . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yes , menu 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Menu button . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	At the centre 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	of this uh picture . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	It will take the user to the previous and the next channel 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	so this is a swapping button . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	The next channel in the numeric pattern , or 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay , okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yes . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So this is our proposed model . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Now the marketing expert has to 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Tell , yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay , well um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	what 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yes , yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	The buttons are all raised 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Are raised , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Right . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Or have two hands to operate it , yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I really like that . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	You really did a good job on that , my little designers . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um and um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	That's that's a really good good thing . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yes , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and it sort of sticks up 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	so that you really 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah , that's great . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Abs okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	The colour's very attractive . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	and 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	these mm-hmm 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	On both sides they're mute ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yes , yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So you can push either one ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	And this brings the menu up on the screen ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Pardon me ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	This brings the menu up on the screen 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	This is the menu yes , yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	and the orange ones are 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	A the the these 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	F f okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Right , very good . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Scroll up or scroll down the channels . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay and now I'm supposed to 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Well , I have one question 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Ah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah , definitely . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yes , which can be easily recognised . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Good point 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah of course , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	and also 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah we can 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Symbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Text . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Text that we can have on the case itself , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	we can 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	That's right . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	And 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm , 'kay , mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	A shell shape . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Right , mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yes , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	we have the snail shell . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So it is 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yes , snail shell . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	yeah , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	He goes right back into his shell . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	yeah 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	shell . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Right . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	because the snail is known to be slow 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Mm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Y Yes 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	of course , yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	you know that would , that would really work . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I think voice recognition is our big selling point 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Mm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yep 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	You know . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Colours . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	We're really gonna have the be the 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Cutest . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	cutest remote control on the block . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Mm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So I think we have to play with the image , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	play with the snail image 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	um play with the visual 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	and then the voice recognition . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I think those are the two things to push . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	The look 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	and the voice recognition . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	They're gonna be our two selling points . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	now uh having said that 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Now we're gonna talk about financing . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Well , there is a production evaluation . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	No ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Is that you ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah , that's me . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	But that's after the financing . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Oh , okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	See ? Fi see ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Um . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay now on the financing we bring up the 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	mm there it is . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ? 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	That's right . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Okay , now . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	So we I guess we use one . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	What ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Well , that's nice . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	It doesn't work . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Oh , okay yeah , okay , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	let's see . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Okay , one , okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Oh go away . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Is that's what we're using ? 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	yeah .

IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay , one . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Uh regular chip on print . No . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	No . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	That's all we need , the one 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .

IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	This is a 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Single curve ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	I guess it's double curved . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Double curved ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	One of those ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Case materi s supplements . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Plastic we said , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	right ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Plastic . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Uh wood , rubber ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Uh but , yes but 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	That's just for the case material , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Is this for the case ? Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	so special colours though , we having that ,

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And then we have to interface push buttons . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Scroll wheel , no . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Integrated scroll wheel , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	L_C_ display ?

IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	No . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Button . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	right ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	No . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm-hmm .

IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Speci 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yes 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Special form ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yes d we do have special form . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	And special material , rubber , wood , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Total seven point six whatever that means . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Uh , I think that's the price . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	That's the price . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	One two three four five six seven eight nine 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Maybe it is it just n 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Eight , eight point two . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Nine points , 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	That's 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	hmm ? 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	okay , yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Eight point two , right ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So , we 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	looks like we are well within budget . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Okay . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Oops . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Uh-huh huh huh . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	On the desktop . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	I just tried that . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	My documents , computer . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	AMI . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	My compu Ah oh here it is , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	AMI should for 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Okay , fine . Save . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay good , so that's the good news . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	We gonna be popular . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Um . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	So that uh 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I think financing was pretty simple . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	'Kay should be able to get it now . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	You wanna go to the next slide ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah right away . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Okay . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	We can't accept every suggestion of course , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	but maybe we just need to get a few . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Mm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So we have to get some input from those people . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um , next slide please . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	so we we've got that . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	The size is small , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	we'll have the soft buttons 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	so that's nice . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Fee selling . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Um so they'll be our main selling points . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	th those have been fulfilled by your prototype 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	and go ahead to the next slide please . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay , so um the shape um I think is a a one . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	That's really , really excellent shape . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	The size is small um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I think that it's 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I think that it's plenty small enough to sell 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	but I think we're sort of right 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	the scale is one to seven . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	And our colour I think is great . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Um I just realised one thing . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Ah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Eight , eight twenty , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Eight twenty so 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	We have um four euros , yeah 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Well um that's 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So um we just have to beware of that . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174		
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yes , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah , still . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	I'm sorry to interrupt then 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Included , yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Hmm , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	hmm 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah mm .

IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Um , I dunno . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	I think I would give it at least a two . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	One . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Mm-hmm .

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Okay . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	It's quite small . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	yeah ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Three . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh maybe two , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Two , okay . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	And the next is functionality 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Well it's also you can't really try it out 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	but um 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	I'll give it a three . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Okay . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Two . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Two , okay . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Uh three , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Three ? 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Okay . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Well , um . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Uh . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Um . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Maybe we can 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	We can always improve , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	yeah , include some more buttons and uh um 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yes , features . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	yeah features . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Uh I think they are quite big , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah , definitely . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yes . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Voices . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	So that that's where we're gonna have to do 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yes . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	And um then maybe we can do something with the um 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	the volume control . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Maybe we can put that all on one button . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And maybe 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	No . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Um . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Uh I think 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	personally I think uh I'm pretty happy . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Even I'm happy . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Um an 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	it's something I think I can market . Yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Uh 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yes , yes you've done a good job . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah , yeah , definitely . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	And I think team work I think was very very good , 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	I think we really 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	yeah . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	And uh I think we 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	are we happy with the means we used ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	well digital pens I guess are these things . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Whiteboard more , yes , yes . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah , probably . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	we didn't use that enough . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yes , we could . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	And we used the slide because it was better positioned . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yes . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	No . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Mm I think that's true mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . 	
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Hmm . 	
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yes . 	
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Um did we new did we find new ideas ? 	
IS1009d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I think we did .
