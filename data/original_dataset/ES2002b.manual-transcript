ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Is that alright now ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Sorry ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Could you plug me in ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Thanks . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	All ready to go ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um so hopefully you've all been working away , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	'Kay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Uh something 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	'cause it's quite long . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So that's something we can discuss as well . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So those are the three things , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um so is everybody okay with any of that 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	, or do you want me to recap at all ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Nope , we're all set . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Right um , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	time for presentations then . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Who would like to go first ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I'll go first . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Sure . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Okay , cool . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Alright um , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Oh yeah , of course , yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	G go on ahead . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	so this is the technical functions design . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Um 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Right 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Right . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	um sh show you now . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	here um the button there and there . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Alright . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	This one's prog . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Sorry . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	That one's perg and that one's prog , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	and it doesn't really tell you what it does . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um it's a very simple one . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	It's got only the basic functions mm 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Oop . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Uh it looked a bit clunky . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	They're very big and not very much use for buttons . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um it's very easy to use . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	which I I quite like having on the controls . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	or something like tha from the bottom of it . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um not sure of how long we've got , uh 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Just a couple of minutes anyway . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	But anyway , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	um we might come to that later . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Shall we sh 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um clunky in what sense , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	like um h heavier ? Larger ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	It's , you know , it's very spread out 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I see , so it's more just basic . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Looks kind of Yeah . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	and kind of you know 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Right , okay . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	got very few buttons on it and 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah . Sure . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Well I think it's a valid point . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	so maybe you know 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	I think that's a good idea . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	I think it's a good idea . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Uh-huh , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Which was that ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Would you like 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Up the numbers , or the up down ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	God , I wou I would say that's required , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I mean would anybody disagree with that ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um , what else , uh 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So don't need to worry about teletext , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	We don't ? No ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	you know like brightness and contrast ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Mm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Is that right ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Is that what we're we're doing ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um , yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	um we need to find out exactly what we have to have 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	um and after that we can add things if they're possible . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Okay , right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Right okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm-hmm yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oka 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	things like channel and volume um are used all the time , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	so we just have them right out on top , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	um very just very sort of self-explanatory . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And others that are uh also available 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	and then others that are concealed . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Something like that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Have I just lost 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Oh no . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	maybe like a mute button , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	that sort of thing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Any of you anything to add to that at all ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	No . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	No . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	I'll add it later , I guess the presentation . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay , right . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Um okay , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Sure . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Do you want to switch places ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Do you wanna 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Can this can this pl reach ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Can this plug come across ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	No . No . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Probably not , actually . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	No . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	So why don't I just pick up and move then . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Here , I'll just 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Why don't I just 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm er , can you go up behind me ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Just just switch them . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Kinda This is so This 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	bit complicated . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I'm all in a knot now . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Um . So I can I can say already , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I dunno whether this is for good or for bad 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Oh , like overlap between what you said ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	but may 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	so um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So how do I how do I get this up ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um function F_ eight . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Alright . So 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	F_ eight ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Oh , and F_ eight . Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	You have to push it together . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yep . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay , I think that that's doing it now . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Nope . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Try that again . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Uh , again ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Wait . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah , you wanna 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Um , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Oh oh here we go . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yep , there we go . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	okay great . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	There you go . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Just um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	and do you know what I mean , so . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Increase that 'cause we can't see the 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	That's much better . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Can you um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	There you go . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Right , okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay . Alright . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	That would be 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So um does that make sense ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So what I basically got is I just looked into some information 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	and how we could 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	and what kind of decisions we could take away from it 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	that we start with the customer , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	and w you know , what they want 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	and what are issues with with um existing products . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh to think about trends 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	which is about fashion in electronics . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	and um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Bouncing on top . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Dunno . Okay . Um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So this is what I've found here , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	um a lot of this is new to me , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	so we'll just read through together . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So they find them ugly . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Most people find them ugly . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Okay I'm gonna 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	we'll look at that in a second . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	they tend to use the most simple controls 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Um , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	frustrations . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	They get lost a lot , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	s as it came up in our last meeting . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Um , takes time to learn how to use them . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	or something that is quite explanatory . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Repetitive strain injury . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Is installing a new remote control something that people 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Uh , no , that did not come up at all . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	I also found that most people would 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	So I dunno 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	if that's possible we might consider getting into it . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Um . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	So want something that looks good and is easy to use , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	big priorities . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Mm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	That's 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	I think it's a good idea . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	That's s that's sort of the um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	But I I'm 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	But not let that confine us technologically . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay . Right . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	So 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Alright ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Any um comments on all of that ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	That's uh 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I mean 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Where's the money , maybe . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	And who watches T_V_ . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	well I don't 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Mm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	But you want 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	they're gonna actually go out and buy one . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Is that too 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Kind of . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	You know how much ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I dunno 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Like a simple replacement , right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	would you 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	how much would you pay ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	These are the age groups which we have information on 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	and these are 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yep . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	What what do you think , Craig ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Sort of the the older group . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Uh , yeah , it's the 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yep . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh f 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	N yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	in terms of 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	to say let's target these people and give them what they want 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Sure . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Sure . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	So um anybody anything there to add 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Just kind of young professionals , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	uh th like 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	So we could say that was our target . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	But 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	So 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So these are people who are gadgety , right ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	when you go on to their working lives , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	people who would you know regular 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . Yeah . Mm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	That that's that's a good point . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Um okay , so um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	If we can . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	if we can . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Why is that ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Could it be an on off thing ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Um , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Like if you want it on 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Sure . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Sure . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So maybe we should 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I suggest that we think about speech recognition , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Sure . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Sure . Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Uh okay , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	well do you wanna um give us your presentation 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay , sure . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	and then then we can 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	I don't know 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah , it's good 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	but this is this is how we're 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah , exactly , yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Not 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Um . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	And not losing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	that they 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	I reckon one problem with speech recognition is 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	um I've actually seen one of them used 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	so you end up yelling at the control for hours . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Really ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Right . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Channel up . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Oh really , you've seen one before . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Sorry , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	do you mind passing me my notepad . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Mm . Course not . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Thanks . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Cool , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	There you go . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	um . Okay . Um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Well this is just the working design um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Well this is just what how I would go about it . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	try to define what we're trying to get done . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	We've used it , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	we're familiar with it , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Besides the basics , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Has to change channels , has to change volume , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Um and I just 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	the idea is just to get everybody to um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	so , you know , things that to start everything going . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	But I guess everybody does have some idea , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	so I don't think um there's a need for that . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	so I'll go into the diagram first . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	It just explains how the process goes through , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	from a 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	from the basic technology point of view , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	the basic steps that you need 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Um okay , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	you need some power source . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Um and that power source is important 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	um how far you can transmit the signal 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	or the complexity of the functions that you want . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Like for example , voice recognition , right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	you might need to power other things , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	so that's one perhaps constraint there . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	um uh a logic 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	which is the receiver here . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	It's fairly general , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	like um voice recognition , right , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	um , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	if it's something which is important then we just add more power 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So it's not really a constraint in that sense , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	what the technology has to do . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Um so I guess the rest of it 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I think we should 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	'Kay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Uh . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Sure . Sure . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah , w I'm done . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Are you are you all done ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	More or less . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	but it's essentially the same thing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Mm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	you know , stuff like that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Right . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	And like on the means b 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I guess this would be 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yep . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Alright , what's what i in 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	This is just um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	The basic principle of 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	a basic principles and basic components that are needed . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	'Kay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	broken down into more components , right , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Uh 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yep . Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So each component represents one function , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	and the power are things that you won't have to care about . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	so we could stay with tha 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	There might be one other problem with the transmission , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Mm-hmm 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Oh , yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	I it 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	you may not require that , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	but you know , um it's it's 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah , mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Then you need to send the signal out , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Mm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Mm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So in that sense , there's not really a restriction 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Right . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Not so much further down . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	And um just a clarification before we finish this . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	There's there's not much specific specific information , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	W 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Because infra-red is something which everybody has . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	W Well well we've um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Just to T_V_ , okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	so that's what we should do for now I think . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Something I was wondering about was the power . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	There's a there's 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	and you add cost to it , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Or you need to get the user to plug it in . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291		
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Okay , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	so 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Okay , so just stick to to regular 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Um , right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	So basically the um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	and what exactly the product's gonna do . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	So um just to recap on 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah , that's good . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Um . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287		
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Okay , right . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Ta . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	or are we gonna eliminate those ? 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Um 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	I think we include mute , 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Okay , I think 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	R is it is it is it s 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Yeah , it's as optional functions . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	I dunno if that'd be a problem . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Yeah . Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	One would be audio controls , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	one would be video controls , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	and the other one would be a device . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294		
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	'Kay , okay . Like that . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	I mean it might help with the visualisation . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	And it would actually help with the component build as well . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay , right . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Mm okay , great . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Um , okay well 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Whoohoo . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.305	um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.307	and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.309	So um I dunno , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.310	just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Um , do you wanna start with David . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Anything else to say at all ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Mm no , not really . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.313	No , okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Um yeah , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Andrew ? 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Shall we do that , then ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Mm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Okay , great . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Um things like on off . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	you know , um so um 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	And and channel . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	And channel . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Right . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Not on off video . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	say you wanna pick up the phone , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	there's a mute button , right , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Okay , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	We put it out . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.324	so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	anything to do with what you hear , right . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Okay . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	You you put that into audio . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Okay , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	And then video is anything that you can see . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.328	and then visual 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Um . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yep . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Colour , yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.330	and then just actual device things , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yep . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.331	like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Sure . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Sure . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yep . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.332	stuff like that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Okay , um 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	and then others which are maybe a bit more 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Yeah . Sure , okay . Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	It's easy to use , I think 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	that's one thing that um 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Okay . 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	'cause things are like fixed . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Okay . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , 	
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196		
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.340	because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.342	Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.343	you know , things like that . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.344	Um , 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.345	so I guess I guess that's it . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Great . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.346	That's the meeting over . 	
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Whoohoo . 	
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . 	
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86
