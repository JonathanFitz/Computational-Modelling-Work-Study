ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um so . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	We'll get to that . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Oh there it is . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um so we're gonna try out our white board . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	I think both . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah . Both . Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Who starts ? 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	We ought to decide who starts and all that . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	No ? 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Any volunteers ? 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Uh-huh . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	I don't think so . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Um . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Make sure my things here . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh-oh . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Right . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay , my favourite animal is 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	see . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Oops . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	A dolphin . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah , it's 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'S like playing Pictionary . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	It's my dolphin . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I like its tail . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	They're graceful . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	they're graceful yeah , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and they're so 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Sleek . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah they're sleek 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	and they look intelligent 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	and I don't know , they're 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I don't know how intelligent that one looks . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah he he doesn't look that smart . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	He's a I dunno um they're 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yes . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	. 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Uh-oh there goes the ten . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It's a cat . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I don't know . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	They sleep all day , they're easy to draw . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Do you wanna anything ? 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Uh yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I dunno if the the 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I think the pen is running out of 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	ah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	So I'll use the spare one . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um but it's harder to draw um . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And the pen's dying . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	A horse . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Horse . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um I don't really know how the legs go , 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	That's very good . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	but anyway I will do that . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	and I like the way they run 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I think that's pretty much it . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Um 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	This cord's 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Uh . Right . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Actually I haven't thought of anything yet . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Uh 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	It's a pig . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	water resistant , strong and furry . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	What do you think , yeah ? 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	And furry . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	This is 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Textile tactile , tactile remote control . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Although 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	uh I'll just put there . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Right . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	You're dragging a you have a tail . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Sorry about that . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So moving on . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	and profit aim is fifty million Euro . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	How many should we sell then ? 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um , a lot , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Anyone a mathematician ? 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	two two two million , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	two mi no , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	more f four million . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Two million . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Four million . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And it 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Oh , yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It is a lot . Uh . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So f that's a fifty percent um uh . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Experience with remote control . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I was thinking that too . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	bec yeah bec 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I've always wanted that , 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	so like you can push a button on your T_V_ 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And even I think a little light . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	In which case you're going to be l 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I don't know if it's expensive maybe to 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Maybe call is enough . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	But yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	and you could 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	You know like a portable phone has a base , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	or if it had a 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	like just to have a home for it . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I mean 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Well that's why it's always in the couch . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah , in in the couch . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	I dunno , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	But that would really make it more expensive . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Something like that . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And the other thing is 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Bigger . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Not 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	well it needs to be sort of 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Like 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Hand 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Hand-sized . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	hand held size , yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I don't think you need a 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Not not huge , but 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	But definitely not well I don't know . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	No , it can't be , uh-uh . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	No it really wouldn't be . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Or like or like a light thing . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Huh . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	You know . I dunno 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Like spaceship . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	. Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	That would be really 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Little homing device . Um . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . Uh . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	So what do we think this remote control should 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Five minutes . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Oh dear . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Till the meeting oh right . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	This is what we have left . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um , oh we just 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah , I agree . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah , yeah yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I mean I know it has to have enough functions 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	You 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	what if um may be a little fancy 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	That would be cool . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Like the way a mobile phone does . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I mean it just seems like 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	what do you call it 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Select . Uh . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	s y yeah but you can programme , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	so you can programme like your favourite channels , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	so like if you had a s 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	That's something we could decide . Mm . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Because 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Because , I don't know if it's 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	I think it's e expensive , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	if you have 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	and then use the telly as a screen . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Right . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	But um 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I'm thinking kind of 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	But yeah for sure . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	is that what you mean ? 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Right . Mm . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Or like you h you see those you know people 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	their their entire house is so electronic , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	and they have like this one master control that 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	and it has like a screen and like 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I don't know if it must be it would probably 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	must be ex too expensive though t 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	like I dunno . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Mm . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Um but it's something to think about , yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Or some it i 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	we can find out probably on the internet how much it's 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Um . Yeah , 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	What was the word ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Furry . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Water resistant . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Oh I was just 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	No but it's 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I thought , ah , spot on . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . Mm , mm . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	That's quite annoying . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	like that's another 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah , clip . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Ooh . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Um . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um . We should probably start wrapping up , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	So . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	The Industrial Designer , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	what does that stand for , I_D_ , 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah I think so . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	yeah 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	um is going to be looking more into the working design . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	The 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	something , 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	what is the U_I_ ? 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	User . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	That's me . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah , what does it stand for again ? 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Uh , User Interface design . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	User Interface Designer . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So that's gonna be 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	more technical . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	So technical function . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	The working design is the structure . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	What is technical functions exactl 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	I I don't really know what 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Um , I guess you'd have to find out . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113		
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	It says on that email but it 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um . 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	It was in the email . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	It does but it I just don't really 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I wrote down what mine were . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	It said um 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	It said 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	What effect should the thing ha should it have , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	okay . Alright . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	like 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	And working design . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Be a medium between you and the telly I think , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah , yeah . Alright . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Mm . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	that's uh 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	And how it works , 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	okay . Right . 	
ES2011a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I'm I'm on task . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	And the M_E_ , what does that stand for ? M 	
ES2011a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Marketing . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Marketing , right . Um . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	So we'll be working on the user requirements , um 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
ES2011a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	So I guess that wraps it up . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I'll see you all in thirty minutes . 	
ES2011a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	I just did .
