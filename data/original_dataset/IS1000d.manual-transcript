IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Tricky . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	I guess I have to change the pen 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	otherwise . Will be completely different . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Dunno . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Might be seat floor rather than person . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	put it back . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	And do you think it's . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Jo's making faces at me . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	So . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Matthew is uh late again . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Probably an important man . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Um . So well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	it is important for him to be here uh . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	So what can you ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	He he he 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	You did work together didn't you ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Yeah we will yeah , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the here . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yes . Yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Uh basically w yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	we we designed the two uh items . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Mm . Um yes 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Um , can we have a phone , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	but w we 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	can someone 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Yes , maybe we should phone him . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	it's really w well designed . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Um well Um , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Mm , object tracking . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	when he is not here 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	we will just we just have to continue . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Um so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	just for record I I will take uh notes again . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	And um well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	'Kay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	when you stay in it's good , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	when you don't stay in you have to redesign . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	So we have to consider that . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Good . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um so 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	we can't no 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Okay 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Matthew . Nice uh you are here . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Great . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Great . Great . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Oh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Yep . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	I will start by the the basic one 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	and uh well 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	first for both they have um a special shape , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	but uh it's like a surf board . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm 'kay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and uh it's kind of interesting shape 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Or browse . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	And also it's not too far from um a mobile . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So people are used to that kind of shape , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	right . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Don't take care too much about the colour 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	because w 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	we don't take 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Eye . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	L_E_D_ . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	the on-off button , in red . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Here would be the volume . On the on the left , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Oh yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Uh-huh . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Mm-hmm , hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	okay , so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	easy to turn on t and off . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And um so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	this is a very cheap version 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	so there are 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	so you can go up and down the channels , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Oh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	no no no , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	this is a single this 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	this is a model with just the T_V_ one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay yeah . Yeah yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	No no 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Ah , okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	just 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	sorry , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	this is a standard T_V_ one , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	we are not talking about that . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	So 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	and then we have usually there twelve keys 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay so 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	it's it's t a very basic remote then , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	it's only 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	It's a very basic minimal thing 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	which you can 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	which is which is also available in the market , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	actually that's what it that it i 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	this one model 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and uh 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Can I see ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	yeah . Sure . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Thanks . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Okay 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I like the volume control , that's good . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Th this is a magic one 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	but I know we don't want to talk about that , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	you know like 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	uh i i i it is a very futuristic , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Uh-huh . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So it doesn't actually have buttons . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So that uh then what we look t 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Did you wanna see ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah no 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	you can carry on , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	This is a model , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	I just look how it feels all . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Just I'm 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah actually , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I really want to talk to it . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	But . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	It won't talk back . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	but but continue with your uh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Uh so well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	then the this is the a more a little uh smooth 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	so all we have 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	uh th you see there are only six keys , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but don't worry 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Right . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	And so they have more space actually 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and uh it's easy to uh use this 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	and uh you have 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	um so 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Play , pause . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	yeah s pause or stop , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	and uh then uh you can uh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	you have a L_C_D_ display , here 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	and uh y this is a functional thing 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	which can change 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	like 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	it's a toggle switch 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	which could change the function 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	say , y you press it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	From D_V_D_ player to television or something . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yeah . I really can change it , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Yes . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	so 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Instead of having many switches , y 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Yes 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	and uh well 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	you can have a integrated microphone over here , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	This is the orange button , the microphone . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	or in the button th here , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	so which can 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	uh basically 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	An 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And here is a small L_E_D_ 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	which is like blinking one , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	okay . And uh well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	then we have a cover 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	basically , basically 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	you don't need much of the time this , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	when you need you can use it , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	and this gives additional functionality 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Crazy dis designer , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Mm . Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	you know . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Design enter . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Yeah . It's basically to do that . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	which shouldn't be shouldn't be 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Oh actually well . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	That th that's true . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	you know , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	uh you want to uh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	more robust . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yes okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	And you have very good chances 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	So the the cost is actually a bit more , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	It 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Sixteen Euros . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Sixteen Euros 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	sorry . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	So it's well outside the budget then . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Then it's out of budget . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	But w 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Three Euros . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	three Euros 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	sorry . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	And um 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	That's on top of the sixteen , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	or is it part of that ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	No no no , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	part of that , yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Part of that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Mm 'kay . Hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Well uh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	if you we can have 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	if you want to 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	you know 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Well 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I think th th 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	we should stick with uh a number of keys 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	because if we add too much then 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	it it should not be cluttering up everything . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	it's too 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	What's this one on the side ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Ah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	that's for the 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Locati . Location . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Ah okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	and as well as it's like a blinking one 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	you know 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	you can keep it aside . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	I like the shape of them , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	I do like the the size and the the shape . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Well well Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yes . Evalua evaluation 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	just do it quickly 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	if if we al already . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um we just go through these 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	and rate them as a group 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	so just average the score of those items , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	so 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	These are the things we identified as being important . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	So well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	or do we wanna discuss them further 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	and then evaluate them ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Um , n no 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	f 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Not sure how this is gonna come out . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	the first one was really very far below budget , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	or just have the high profit on it ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Mm , well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	And then I mean w w w you must just see it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	we can still spend this four and a half Euro 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	and to r 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Functionality . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Okay so 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	look and feel , innovation 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	And now it easy to use . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Easy to use . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	target . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	And trends . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Oh , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Is that part of both of them or ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Um well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	w w we can still discuss that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So um , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	because they are too expensive , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	but 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	No . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	No . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	No okay , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	No . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	maybe we can start with this , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	uh , calling this one . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Okay . Yep . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	it's the pink . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Th th this is the first design . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	And the other one's green . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yes . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Okay , so 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	look and feel ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Where um one is 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I've broken the pen again . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Uh there is another pen . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	S 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Get that one . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Um w one's bad 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	and seven's the best . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Sorry , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	one's true 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	and seven's false . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	One's the best . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	So on a scale of one to seven ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	'Kay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Okay . So . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Look and feel . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	you already feel that uh pretty much I think . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Mm-hmm , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	But that's just half , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	we should also consider look , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	and then i it looks quite conventional . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Don't you agree ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Mm yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	maybe two . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Hmm . Hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	so 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	I 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	It's my opinion , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	but I don't know what what 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Well 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	I will give it maybe we have anyways 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	you know . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	It 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	though the look is fine 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	but uh still I will give four in that case 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Yeah . Four maybe . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	you know . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Four ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Four yeah 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Four , four . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Now we th th 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	that 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	then we settle on four . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	I will gi 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Uh . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	'Kay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Can you maybe fix the other 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	If you press like this not like this 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	then you 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	No 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	that's the 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	No . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	C can you get the batteries ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	ink's dried . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	No no 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	the battery has fallen down , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Battery's low , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	that's i 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	isn't it the ink ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	The b 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	that's the that that one ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	battery there . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	But 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	No no it's not that , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	it's how to close a battery . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Okay ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Now it should be . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	No 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	I think it's lost a battery . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Mm , try it , just try it . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	No 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	it's 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Oh it will not 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	It would still write 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	ri 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	mm , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Is there another battery there ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Oh yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	You got a second ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Try a 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	we won't be able to tell . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yes , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	it it has a mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Perfect . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Is that working ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Did it come out ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Good . Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Good . Good . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	it's just a normal whiteboard marker 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Okay . So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	then then 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	And the other one ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Wow . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Ah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	I think it's slightly better , um , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	I I I 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	but 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	When we want to include I I 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	I'm doubting about this this component . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	It it it it breaks 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	in your 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	'Kay 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	maybe 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	No 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	it it's n i it is jus 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	It's not a button 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	it's a led , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	it's a 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	It's a led actually 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	which which 'll be covering in a curve 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Mm , yes I see , mm okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	It's will be embedded there 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . Oh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	so it won't be really you know protruding or something . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	you can push push it again , you can push it . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	maybe it won't work so well . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	No you it it not protruding actually , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	it will go in better into that 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	r r 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I'd say two or three for that one , personally . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Probably more towards three than two . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	I think the look is better 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	but the feel is is is worse . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	So so I would also say this is four . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	But w w do you what do you think ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Uh it's fine I think . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	My just that um the feel is that um you 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	right now you you don't see the feel 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Mm . Mm . Yes . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	This is how embedded one will 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yes , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	it basically is the same shape . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Mm-hmm . Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	You will be Except that in this c 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	And you might have a slight thing for to forward and 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Mm , okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	So I will say two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yes , okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	I would say two , three . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	So , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	consensus ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Two or three ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Two ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Mm . Two's good 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Two ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	yes . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	looking like 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Um , 'kay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Innovation . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	The first one , not really muc 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	right ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	No but except for the design of the surf . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Do we 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yeah . The surf uh design . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	What What features are we actually including ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	You should be rea 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Uh no 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	I think it's more of the feel . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	There's nothing like that ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	it's just a straight-out remote control . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	The only innova innovation is the shape . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Say about that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	S so that 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	there's no 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah . You're right . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	So I'd be up for seven for innovation . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	And the And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	And um with many more functionalities , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	and can open and close the the bottom part . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	it gives it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	A and the L_C_D_ screen is 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yep . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Got the L_C_D_ screen . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Uh Yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	automatic speech recognition . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Is that in this one though ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Is this 'cause this is the 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	No , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Th th there were different options we discussed then , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	we ha 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	We just diske discuss it as you designed it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	and then we will will try to get it in the budget . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	So the cost for these were 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Eight . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Eight . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Well 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	actually we have yeah to check again yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah , eight Euros yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	And this one was sixteen Euros . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Sixteen . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Sixteen Euros . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Okay . So . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Innovation for this one is two ? One ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	It's a two , I would say two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Two ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Two . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	yeah , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	I don't see 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Why it is one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	okay , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	one would would be without buttons , . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	A man w w 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Mm . Well 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yes . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Bu 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	So maybe we can put one . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	This this is it w with the speech recognition ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	It's using speech recognition , yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Okay yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Well . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Gi given that that it works , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Give it a one ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah , one , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	then it's I think one . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Ease of use ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Uh 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	the first one is really standard , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	He is used to it act 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	right ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	They are used to it actually . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yep . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Here there may 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Uh , though it has more functionality 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	So maybe a three or a four . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Uh yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	actually in fact I think it will be 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	One me um we hope 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	but y 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	And there is a 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	like 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	I would say three . Or maybe four . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Consensus ? Three or four ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	we have reduced the keys actually you see . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Three , I would . Three . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Three is fine with me . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Yeah , yeah 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Three ? Okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	it's a 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	No . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	it's not so easy , like this one the normal . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yes 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Is quite easy yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	So so I think th three is good . Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Good . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	What's the next ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	three's 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	uh how well it goes to the target demographic . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Twe twenty to forty , yes that's 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	That's 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	This one would be uh for grandmothers . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Oh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	no , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	this would I 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	I would I would give this model to the old people actually . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	No . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yeah , grandmothers , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	So sh completely changed our demographic there , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	And 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	it's not part of the the funky young thing . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah that's true . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	but 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	That's it's still Ye 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	that's right . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Oh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	yeah , . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Do you agree ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	And 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	I 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Well 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I think 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	right ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Yeah . Uh yeah 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	But w 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	But it's going to be cheap whatever though , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	it was set with i 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	we've got a set price . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	And people can still decide to use the cheaper one 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	instead of a 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	But for us it's 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Mm , yeah , indeed . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Ju just think , twenty five Euros , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	I mean it's not going to be cheaper . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	So in that case well it's fine then . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	We can 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Mm . Mm . Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Okay . Um 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	And the demographics of 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	It's got the got the the toys in it , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	it's got the L_C_D_ screen 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Yeah 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	tha tha tha tha tha that's 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	and 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	I think it's better , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	because of the L_C_D_ screen 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	which is really an appeal on the on the on the 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	on the and on the 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	And if you want to target 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Mm . So , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Because it 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Mm . Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	so . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Wh what what 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I'd probably go with three again for that one . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	I think it's uh it has more market actually . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Or even Even one and two . Or two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Y yeah , you know 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	No 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	s say t two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	So , two , yeah ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Two ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . Two yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Yeah two yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Because tomorrow this will be more appealing 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	because you can add lot of sophistication on that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Yep . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	for the people to 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	and that makes it more appealing , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	it's more of a a new fun toy . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	We have to practically test it . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	The field test will tell you how good . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Okay , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	the final point , trends . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	And following the trends . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	The trends . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Mm . Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	as it is , not really doing either of them . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	I think 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Well , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	I know some 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	and 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	not not exactly spongy 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Uh okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	it's got just a one bit on it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Yeah I know . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	and so you can 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	that feels kinda spongy . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	So it's sort of , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	Mm . Okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	So Uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	But that's if you're using the covers . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	And the then we can al 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Or is it just one 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	We can we can consider 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	I mean 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	they make it for mobiles , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	it can't be that much more complicated . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	But why do you want to cover that actually ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	In that uh w in the mod 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	just with the with the flexible plastic uh 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah . This is possible . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	I th I th I think 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Uh uh y are you sure ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	O o or just two things which can be put on each other . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	exactly like Nokia phones . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yes , exactly like it . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Uh , so 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Maybe we can 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	but we have to decide it , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	and s now try to invest in the in in the features . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	it lets people have the latest fashion 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Mm mm mm mm mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	and then it'll still be in fashion . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	'Cause sometimes 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	and uh it's quite conventional , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yep . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Mm . Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	So so so that that would make the trends equal , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	so we we we really have don't have , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Mm . There's n 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I mean 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Yes , indeed . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	so a a point better for the for the number two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	Okay . So . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Two and three , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	or one and two ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yes . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Yeah , it's one . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Say , say one and two . One and two . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	le le let's see . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	d 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	this one has spongy but buttons ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	Okay . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	it says a 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Okay so 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five mm nine by five , one point s eight ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Just add it . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Nine . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	You know . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	One point six , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	Three , six , seven . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	one point 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	One point eight yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Four point Uh four point two . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	yep . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Very good . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	But we still got a very different price for those two 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	so they're not really comparable yet anyway . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	We we must try to get them closer . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Both in i i 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Wow . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	or we just have to choose . And adapt . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Yep . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Yes , well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	That'll basically take us down to the budget . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	But I'm 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	now 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	uh and uh I explained them 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Yeah . Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Mm , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	so maybe we have to recap with this one . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	tha 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Well yes , well uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	re reconsider it . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	uh what kind of energy source uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	I I 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	we didn't speak about that . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	It's a it's a normal battery , or 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	it migh It 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	it'll need uh more than a conventional one , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	it won't be uh just 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	What do you say , Mael ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	For this one it's a normal battery . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Electronics . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Uh sample speaker , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Yeah , yes , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	or sample sensor , yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Sample , yeah , this one . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Yes , this one . Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Case ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Um , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	So 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Curved . Double curved 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	yeah right . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	I see I 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	It's uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Double curve . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322		
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	Mm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	which one are we talking to ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Are you talking about this or that ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	Either of them . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Oh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	yes , we are talking about , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	but they have the same shape , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	but , actually bu 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	th th this would be double curves ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	'Kay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Uh , plastic would be the material . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	Yeah . The basic one , yep . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Is it zero Franc ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	A special colour ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Uh 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	Push . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	Mm , yes , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	but 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	L_C_D_ is . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Ah good . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	th 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	now this is per per unit , this number of components . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	So it would need twelve buttons . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	No 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	but for this one it's twelve Euro . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	No , for that one also . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	There are twelve ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	So , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	that's a scroll . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	t 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	Yes . Twelve I believe . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	So this comes to eighteen . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	And that's without any special button supplements . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	Yeah , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	one scroll wheel you might need . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	They're not just standard buttons . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	Uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	I think but th do you agree th that thi 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Wait a minute , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	it's not it's not double curved , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	it's single curved , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	right ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Because it's there is no like . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	Yes I 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	But I thought it would be curved on two 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	Yes 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Well 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	it's 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	you know 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	You talking about concave curves ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	Uh-huh . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	yeah concave . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	So I think we can put um 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	Both . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	You think a single curved ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	the single curved in the sixteen . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	That makes uh seventeen . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	And what are just 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	Yes . Uh 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	We have more , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	we've got those the scroll wheel on the side 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	I had a bad uh bad estimation . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	and yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Bad estimate , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	W d 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	right ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	The sc 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	we have we haven't talk about a , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	but it is not in the list . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	We've got a scroll wheel for the volume 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	don't we , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	or is it some other thing that's not on there . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	W ho h 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	is this a scroll wheel 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	No no no . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	'Kay 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382	we've only got five minutes left guys 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	Mm . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Okay , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	so based on that , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	yeah , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	um where is the es okay sample speaker 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	So um 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	But still , yeah it 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	We just need that actually . We need one . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	We're 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	but then we can't have the the speech recognition , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	yes ? Yes ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	No we cannot , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	So so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	So 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	S 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	w when we w a 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	But the um 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	Yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	and this needs a needs a advanced chip . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	Transti 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Right , Matthew ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Oh 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	I i it 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Or regular chip ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	I think it's going to be y y 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	Say say it's regular , regular chip , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . Okay . Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	and we still on fifteen , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	So . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	Yes but that maybe 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	we can just say 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Uh 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	one . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	When you look at this w , this u uh item , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	Ca l we are just 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	But 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	So is it possible ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	That'll be 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382		
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316		
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	No no , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	he he he I I 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	Well 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317		
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	no ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.389	the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	And uh we don't want to to change that 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	right ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	We we really want a L_C_D_ 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Uh 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	It's evident . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.390	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.391	So 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	And I dunno 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.392	twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.393	we can't do anything about that , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.394	so ten fifty , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.395	if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.396	um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	Sorry 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	the chip's up there already . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.389	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	there's no doubt about that . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.390	A 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Do you think it's important ? 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	I dunno , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	I'm just asking . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.391	Mm 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	Yep . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.403	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.404	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.405	I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	Okay so we can get rid of it 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Yeah , it's true yeah . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	and then add a couple of buttons . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	But uh , do we want that ? 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.392	Mm . I 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.406	For the price , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.407	it's gonna be what we can afford , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.408	and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.393	I think we have to come to a decision now , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.409	Mm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.394	just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.410	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.395	so 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	right ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.396	Yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	Yes . Yes . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	One man one vote . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.411	I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	I think but 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	We need to be . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.412	Bu y you're a power voter 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.413	uh veto anyway as Project Manager . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	Mm-hmm , I know , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Yeah . . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	but 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yeah 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.414	well 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.415	we have to make a decision now , that's it . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.403	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.404	So uh uh 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.405	having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.406	Is that acceptable ? 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.407	Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	Yes . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.408	You've you you agree . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	W I I I just 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.409	So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.410	So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Because one 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	yeah 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	th 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	show me that 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.411	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.416	Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	Okay , . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	That will create another problem . For the people to use it . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	It's not going to be easy . Doing that . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.417	Okay . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Okay . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.412	Mm . So um 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.413	I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	No , 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.414	Just 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	and introduce two more buttons . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.418	Okay . So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.419	L_C_D_'s out , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.420	is speech rec out now ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.421	We've 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.422	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.415	Uh where , L_C_ 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.423	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.416	Okay 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.417	w we now we can just uh 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.424	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.425	are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.426	Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yes . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.427	So 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.428	just look at 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.429	forget that one and look at that one now . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.418	Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.419	and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.430	Mm . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.431	Yep . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.420	okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.432	Okay . Well 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.421	My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.433	that's that's 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.434	Yep . 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Actually yeah , 	
IS1000d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.435	So . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.436	Mm . 	
IS1000d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	Yeah . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.437	Yep . So 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.422	Okay . 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.438	w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.439	and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in 	
IS1000d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.440	but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.423	Okay , 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.424	good . 	
IS1000d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.425	Then we the same .
