IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Hello everyone . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hi . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hi . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hi . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Um how uh how we doing ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah , good . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	meaning gathering i suggestions 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	So we should address that . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	that has infra-red bits 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	mm uh uh child lock 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Francino who is our um 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Interface designer . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	It should be compact . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yes . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yeah . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yes . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	then we I'm looking for three presentations . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I don't I don't think so , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	so whoever w wants 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay , I can start first . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah , okay . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Now my slide , please . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay , your slides . Okay . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Oh , come on , close already . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	And that's number two , right ? 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Three . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Three . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Participant three . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Yes . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Okay . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Next , please . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ? 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Pardon me ? 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Nine channel switches ? 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Is 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yes , nine numbers . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And then you have swapping of uh button 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Then it should have a next button , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Going to the nex next . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Now there should be a memory switch . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	There should be a mute button . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_ . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So this is one one of the interface which can be created . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Then , please , next slide . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Even a kid can use that . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	And this has in-built voice recogniser . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Can you go on to the next slide ? 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And this comes with different colours , different shapes . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Mm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	and all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	attractive child interface . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	You don't know me . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	this . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I could lose that in a minute . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So this is 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	This i this is one such interface which can be created . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Right . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Thank you , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	that's 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay , thank you very much . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh any comments on uh her presentation ? 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um what uh I'm 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	No suggestion's bad . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm yes . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I don't think that we can get uh 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	The T-shape is good , the child one is good , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , I I th I think 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	No , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah mm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Have to come back to that later . Okay . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	We can . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	but if 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Mm right . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Ho who wants to go next um ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah , maybe . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Mm-hmm . Okay , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	and you 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Participant two . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Uh okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh the next one , sorry . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Oops . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	It's it was the old one . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Components . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	The components design . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	it's like 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh it can be a plastic one , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	hard plastic , so that it can be strong , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	So it should be strong . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	And it should be recyclable . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Uh and uh , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm-hmm . Good point . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	yeah , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	and also uh using of colouring compon components 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	and uh also a capacitor 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Can you go on to the next slide , please ? 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	A battery 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	uh , I would like to suggest one thing 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	uh if we 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	It it it's not a high voltage battery . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Can you go to the next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And how it works , how the remote controller works . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Go away . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Thank you . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Then it will do the appropriate action . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So uh this is how the remote controller works . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	It works . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Can you go to the next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah , I have few pictures . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	this is a normal remote controller . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And to the next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And where we had a a few buttons and all . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	uh um mm yeah , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	and di and a diode transistor . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	The electronic components 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah , di um can y uh 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Mm yes . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yes . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Uh and also there are uh um resistors 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	uh sorry , ther there is a diode . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Can you go go on to the next slide . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So uh this is the circuit board . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	The green one is a circuit board . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	It's not exactly wires we are using . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It's just printing something on a board . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	uh th it will 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Transmit . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Can you go to the next slide , please . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Uh so this is 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	They they are the circuits . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yes . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Next , please . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	uh or we can use solar sells . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Hmm , that's interesting . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Uh . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Um . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	And you have more pictures . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	but titanium we can't use . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	An Yeah , that's it . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	It's all for me now , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	thank you . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	well thank you . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Any particular comments by anybody ? 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Um . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	We'll just go for push buttons 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	for in the interest of cost . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Push-buttons . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	We don't have a lot of time left 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	and we will still have to make a decision , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Okay . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Go right to my first my next slide . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Uh okay . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	And I would encourage you all to do the same . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Um people like something that really fits in their hand . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	'Kay . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Simple is beautiful . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	They don't want to have to squint at small print um , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	and they don't care for the mode thing . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	They want each button to do something . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And eye-catching is important . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Go ahead , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	I'm trying to finish fast for you . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	And uh so what do we think on the concept 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	of the remote ? 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh yes , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Y 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Okay . Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , but w 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	This could be uh one feature which could be sellable . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I think that's 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	That that be really good , yeah , I agree with that . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work , 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Distance problem ? 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	like maybe different people will be having different voices , 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	so it like it's uh everything so i 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Uh . 	
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Well , you you teach You have to teach uh 	
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . 	
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	No , it's it's , uh yeah , 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th 	
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user ,
