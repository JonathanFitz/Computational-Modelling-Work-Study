ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Right well . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um okay , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	oh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Okay 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and then uh uh just tidy up with production 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and um and then we can close . Um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh okay 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	we basically have the same kinda lay-out here 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	it's just um 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	you hold it like this 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	so you can hold it and scroll , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	or you can hold it and and push . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15		
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh this is the power key , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	um it's kinda like the biggest 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	so you know how to turn on . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Uh that's the little menu key . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	This is the infra-red section 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	so you g 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	it'll be sending rays 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Yep , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	yeah , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	good , good . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	so you can you know talk to it like that 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	and it'll still understand . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yep , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	right . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um the logo is down down there um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Mm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	S 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and has the cover on it 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	and you can see like it just kinda goes 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	the red bit's the cover 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and it kinda goes over everything 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Yep , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	yep , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	just kind of a light non-descript grey 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Yep yep . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	so that people'll wanna buy the covers 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yep . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	so they kinda just stretch over . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	showing me age , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8		
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32		
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yeah , well 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I I didn't know that 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	but yeah they're kind of 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	it's just kind of a rubbery 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and that way 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	you know 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	spongy like is something that people wanted 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Okay , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	yep , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	right . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	and it just sort of stretches over 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	and 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Okay . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	you actually have to screw them on and stuff 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Yep . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	just kinda stretch it over 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	and it'll be fine . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Okay , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	and it'll just stay on 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	good yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	and then the buttons come through 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	and so and then the 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yep , right . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Li 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Like that . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Right . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Okay 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah it could stand , yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Oh . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	but uh uh 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Well 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	we could broaden the broaden it out a bit 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	so it would stand like that . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah , uh no 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah , standing . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	and uh 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	we could just widen it out uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	it gives gives people the option 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and if if say if they've got them um 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	because actually have several upon the uh 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah , well . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Have to 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	if we just lengthen it I guess 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yeah 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Yeah , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	so it comes down to the base of the hand 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	just kind of 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	but that that's uh but uh 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	and then flatten it out 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	and could sit there . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	no 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Or just make it little . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah , mm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Somewhere like that 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	yeah yeah , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	no no , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I mean that's these uh 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	so it just sort of 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	We might have to lengthen it 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Yeah 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	so it kinda your hand still holds it 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and have it there , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Bu 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	yeah , kinda like that 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	kinda like a flower or a plant 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Mm . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	for the more natural kinda 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	. 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	The final product would actually stand up , yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah , yeah , yeah , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I mean it it's uh wouldn't 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	fall over . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	But th th but th yeah th b the 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	these were all minor minor uh minor details , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	. 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	'S a little longer . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Wee 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	and the i 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Mm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Um , so 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	good that's that that's excellent . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Um right 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	let us um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	What's on the next one ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Oh right yes , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	let's have a look at the um f finance . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um , now 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	we're given a a clear design brief , uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	if I get the uh spreadsheet up . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Oh . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Uh yeah , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	just click there . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	. 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Uh the the maximise button . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Oh right . Ah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Good , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	this is why we need to make these things simple 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	so that the uh the the the boss can understand . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Now 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	I've um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	um I wouldn't know for in 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	that's a that's a standard colour . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Uh , so 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	we're just simply on batteries , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	so , um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	that I don't think is a a serious problem . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	so that that has to stay . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Um it's simply made of plastic 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	so th that's uh that's no problem 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	and uh um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Um and uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	we haven't actually got a scroll wheel 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	so um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	and the and the the buttons are 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	uh uh well 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I do don't know that they're special colour . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Anyway 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	so uh um you know 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	the if if 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	so uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	and uh uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Okay , uh . So um . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Does anybody want to uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Evaluation . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	The the product or the project ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	The the the well the I meant the product . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um , well well 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	my presentation just now ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Sure , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	uh can I get the 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Oh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	sorry 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	yeah um , mm . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Cheers . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	There we go , oh . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	So 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	um gauge our team response to these questions . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	So , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Seven being a nice round number to work to . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And then at the end just take an average 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Tr 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	On for true and seven for flase . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Yes . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yes . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43		
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	So uh . So , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	look at these questions . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Well 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I think most definitely . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Yeah 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	I think it is yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I'd say definitely a one yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So uh 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and also uh technologically innovative ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yes 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah , defi yeah , yeah 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	the voice technology indeed . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Easy to use ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	I don't see we could've made it any easier . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Uh suitable for the consumer ? 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	That was um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Totally . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah definitely . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Yeah 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	I think it made we met all of the consumer 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	wants . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Uh is it complicated ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	No . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	No . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Doing pretty well so far 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	aren't we ? 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Uh functional ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah definitely . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um . Where are we ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	found easily . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	yeah 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	I mean that's that's 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Does it take long to learn to use ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Shouldn't . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	No , not at all . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And uh , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	what else ? 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Less buttons 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	well . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	so it must be . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	We we 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	uh yeah 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	it was our it was a 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	we made an actual effort to 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	So yeah , um um . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Um will device appeal to all age groups ? 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I think it will 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I think so . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	uh that's a good call , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Mm . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	yeah . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Well 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	And it's it's it's 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	well 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Mm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	It will appeal f for dif for different reasons 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yeah 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	I think just the simplicity of it 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	but it's it's uh 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	yeah yeah 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	and 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	so I I yeah I 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	not having to learn to programme 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and not having you know a million buttons . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	so 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62		
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	why not ? 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105		
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Uh , yeah 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and what h did we make the management's 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	is t it's television only , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yep . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	it's it's simple to use , 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	um it's it's it's within budget , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Under the cost . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Mm-hmm . Yep . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110		
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Um . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	So uh 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I I think we've done an amazing job 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yep . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	in uh 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Okay . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Well done us . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	coming up with what 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	So uh 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Yeah , . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113		
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Need a need a calculator for that . 	
ES2012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Excellent . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Okay , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	nick the cable back then . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	I mixed up the colours a little bit . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Oh no 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	that's 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	I think I all wrong . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Ooh . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Right 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	do um 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	either of you want to uh say anything ? 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Uh . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Mm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Before I uh 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118		
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Ps 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	I don't think so , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I mean 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	No . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	I think we worked well together 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	. 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	and you know , 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	seemed to discuss things pretty well 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	and come to group consensus 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	and 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Well 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	that's right ,

ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	I mean 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Um I won't comment on leadership , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	uh I think the results speak for itself 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Mm . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh 	
ES2012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Yeah . 	
ES2012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yep . 	
ES2012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	uh a new approach .
