ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Right uh . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	So um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	So where's the PowerPoint presentation ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Sorry ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Microsoft PowerPoint , right . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Right , okay . So . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Right . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Okay , so we've got uh 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	so we've got new project requirements . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	So basically we've got three things , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Three presentations . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	We have a 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	I guess we have a presentation each , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	'cause I've got one . Um . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	I've got one too . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	I see , right . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	That's nice to know , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	one from each of you . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Um new project requirements . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Um so do we want to do the presentation first , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	or do we want to um 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	W I I got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	We discussed that last time 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um we've got uh teletext outdated . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Um did you get any information on that ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Uh we didn't , no . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	No . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	I d I didn't personally . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	So I I got that in email form . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Um . Right okay . So 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	So we'll start with yourself 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Okay that's fine . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	on the basis that uh 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Sorry , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	yep . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Oh . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	What is it ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	I'm not quite sure how it 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	I think you've got to do um control F_ eight . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Control 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Shift F_ eight . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Alt function F_ eight . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Again not doing anything . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	There's usually a little thing in the top right for the 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Oh hang on , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Oh . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Ah there , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	it's just coming on . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	it's doing something . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	pressed about five times now . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Okay , that's me . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Okay , um I have to go again . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	it going ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Hopefully that should be it this time . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Okay , I think we're there . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	That's good . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Okay , um 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um of the of the remote control . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Um I've just got three sections , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and how it connects with the television . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Um the basic components are an energy source 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	but is not actually part of the remote itself , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	because that's obviously found in the television . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	. 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	so . I'll just go through there . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Oh I'll j 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	I think it's that little 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Oh I see . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Oh okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	I'll get rid of the bear.$ 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	it's magic . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Okay that's great . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Uh no , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	a power supply 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	which we'd probably get 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	it's probably gonna be the battery . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Um 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	we then have a particular button , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	which may be 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Um but this is how the basic system works . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Um that sends 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	after you press that that sends the message to the chip , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	which um then sends 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	It sort of interprets which button you've pressed 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Um . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	So that's . That's the remote in itself , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	that's the components of the remote 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and how they work together . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	So this is the uh user interface . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Um this is the chip itself , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Ah yes , that's the power source . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Um . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	just because of the size . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Um and then the sender , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	So the battery is the in the sender . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Um 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yes . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	'Kay and that's it for the moment . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	So , now more design . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Right . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Thank you . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	That's what we like to hear . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Did I press function ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Is it control function 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Oh . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	ei Oh , th there you go . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Um here are two example remotes . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	it looks much more user friendly . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	So , it's got nice big buttons , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	it's got a very limited number of buttons . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Um they're nice , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	kinda clearly labelled . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	So it's very very user friendly , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and it's got a little splash of colour . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Could maybe do with some more colour . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Well there's a couple of things there . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Do we get to see that ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	I haven't as yet , no . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Will you be presenting that in a bit ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So uh I'm guessing that uh uh 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	I notice on the bottom there it's got uh 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	what's that ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	A_P_O_G_E_E_ 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	that might be the corporate colour scheme , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	because that seems to be for a video as well . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	So we could dispense with that little bit as well 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	What do you mean by the circular section ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Possibly ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Like all of that bottom bit ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	J yeah yeah yeah j yeah 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	just this little bit 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	is that 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	I think that's still um a video remote part , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	so maybe we could get rid of that as well . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Well b uh w 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Well th the on the 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Like how often do you hit nine ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	It's just people are used to seeing that , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	But but 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	so if we didn't have them then they might think it's 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	But , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	well possibly 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	but presumably it'll take a second 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	'cause you have to be able to stop it . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	that w 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	and then you could dispense with more otherwise . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Um some remotes have kind of favourite options 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	and that would cut down your time . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Mm . Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Anyway . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Whatever . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Okay . Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Limit the number of buttons , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	user friendly . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	But I suppose nine's not really excessive . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	I suppose it does make a good pattern . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Yeah 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Well that's true , yeah , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	that that makes sense . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Does . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	So w so what was the circular thing that you were 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Um I think that's just for a video , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	so we wouldn't need any of that at all . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	So we could get it down to what ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	So we get to 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	How many buttons have we got ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	We've just got ten , eleven twelve th 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	We got fourteen that we need . I guess . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Um which isn't really too many . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	or was I meant to give you that information ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Um 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	I'm not sure . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	I had I've had some market information , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	but not from the company , no . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Right . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Right , okay , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	so basically time to market seems to be important , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	therefore speed of delivery . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	We've only got about another four hours left . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Ah yes yes , that seems good . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Right well that's the end of my presentation . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	I'm gonna pull this off . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	I think she said twenty seconds to um 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	I'm sure we'll have by the end of today . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	I'll give it another go . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Yeah , there we go . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Right , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	and um how do people use it ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	and what improvements would would they like to remote control . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	And young people were quite receptive to this , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Okay , so 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	A design which looks high-tech , basically . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	That's worth thinking about . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Okay um , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	and that's the end of the slide show . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	That's it . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Cool . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Do a lot of um 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	What was that last wee bit there ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Um about speech recognition ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Speech recognition , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Youn young people pref 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Well that's right . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	So you can press a button which is always kept in one place 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	That is true , yes . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	I can't remember , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	and then they whistle back , or something like that . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Sounds reasonable . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	That'd probably be really simple , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	they're cheap . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yeah . So 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	But if you 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	I know . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	You'd want to try and av just have the one product 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	that if 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Um I dunno um talking about vo 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	because it'll recognise the voice 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	and you can give it a command , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	a set command whatever that happened to be . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	you could have an option to turn it off . Or 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Perhaps , um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	So uh 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Any sugges 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Well , any conclusions ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Mm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Considering 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Well if it does then we can't . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	It's that simple , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	We've got um the remote was only for the television 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	and not for 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	because that would make it too complex 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	and we have to get it market quickly . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	So that means that uh 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	So we're being focused effectively directly at a television 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yes . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Has to be simple enough to 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	because time to market is is critical . S 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	It would . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	'Kay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Added extras would be nice , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	which effectively now is sort of four hours . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	So and if 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	and we've gotta get to the end . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Okay . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	So 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Right okay , uh so I need to 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Right . So 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	About five minutes . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yes . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	We'll also know w when the next meeting is 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	And then we can report back at the next meeting 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Does that make reasonable sense ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Yes that seems right . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Do it via the email 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Okay . Yep . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	so that rather than coming you know 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Come along with it in the next meeting , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	we can discuss it then 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	and take whatever action is appropriate . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Okay . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Right , is there 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	I would guess so . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	and 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Yep . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	I w well uh i 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Something simple . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	and if something comes back 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	something that's quick and simple . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	So , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	sounds good . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	'cause everyone can whistle or clap , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	now something that doesn't like whis uh 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Well I I I don't know . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	but if 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	No , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	clapping , I think clapping , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	I'd go more 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	f more for clap . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	so uh so clap option . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Uh . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Is that one of the 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Taking out teletext , okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	so so take out teletext . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Right . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Yeah , I think so , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	so zero to nine . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	so you can press any two 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	and it'll sort of put them together . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Okay , ten numbers 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	and then some kind of device to allow uh 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Or multiple digits . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	You had an had an idea about the menu ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	but that again is probably an expense that 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	But just thinking um people probably 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	I mean you don't have 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	but you have to be able to tune it that once . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	You can't really avoid that . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	No . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	So that'll be in 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yes . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	and if it is at the moment , that's fine . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	But at the moment it's not , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	and the idea is to have an international market 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Mm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	which is 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	And it's also m it's 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214	so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	I s I suppose um 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Possibly . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	That's right . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	So how would this menu function work ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108		
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	that would be a good idea , yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	like the volume or something . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	My dad was watching a film the other week 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	and it was too dark , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	we're gonna have the the individual numbers 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	and then a menu function 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Presu uh 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Uh 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217		
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Right , okay um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	so you're basically pressing 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Right . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Okay , well . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Mm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	So y 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	So you don't use it that much , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221	Ah That's a very good idea . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	you don't have to see it all the time . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	But it's all there if you need it . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	That is that is a good idea actually . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Sor sort of a second . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	So you keep um 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Like a hidden panel . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	I don't know if you've got the same . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Uh not quite , but I guess . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Keep the other buttons but hide them away . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	And that'll be better for the older generation as well 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Ah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	So 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	That's right . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	data functions hidden at back . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	So th the 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Can bring out when needed . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	uh sorta 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	That's right 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	so we're dis 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234	So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	and which ones are gonna be on the back . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	So sh 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	We have to decide . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	I guess so . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	So on the 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	So on front , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	about the number . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	numbers , 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Um the volume up and down . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	And the volume ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	volume . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Shall we have a mute button as well ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	Sorry ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	A mute button as well . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Mm . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Yeah 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Or 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	I think they're handy . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	And probably a power one as well . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Dunno . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Have you seen the adverts ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.219	But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.220	'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.221	We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Uh-oh danger sign . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.222	I think you probably should . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Yeah , 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245		
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	but a little bit smaller . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Compromise . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Well . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Okay , so we'll have um 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Right . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.224	So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Um . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Channel up and down . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	What else have we got ? 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	What was that , sixteen ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Numbers is ten , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178	volume is twelve , 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	th Yeah si 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Volume button . How many volumes ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	One up , one down . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Right okay . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	On mute . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	And a mute , yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Is there anything else ? 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	I don't think so , no . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.252	Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253	So is that it ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	so . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.228		
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Okay . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.255	That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	And then at the back ? 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	You've got brightness and contrast . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	And then 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Okay . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.258	So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.259	anything else ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Uh there's audio functions . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.260	You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.230	So tuner up and down , I guess . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Tuner , would that have up and down ? . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Um up Tune one way , tune the o 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	I think they normally do . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.262	okay . Okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.232	I I dunno I dunno possibly . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Oh yeah 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.234	and th and a enter button just to select . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.237	We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.238	because it's just volume up , volume down . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.239	Um . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . 	
ES2014b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Yeah . 	
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Okay . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Um maybe for the younger market . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.241	or do you have to do it via the remote ? 	
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . 	
ES2014b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .
