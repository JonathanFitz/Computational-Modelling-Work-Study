ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Alright , yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	crack on . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Okay so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	the idea to try and separate us 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um that pretty much sums up the last one . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	So 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	we'll just crack on , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Uh uh okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um uh the con today is the concep today . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I'll just 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	and is um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Sorry about this . . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	um will we have to construct any items ourselves ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh I have a presentation 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I just saved it in the uh the folder . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yeah , okay 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	well 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Which one do y 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Uh . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Oh , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	interface concept ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Yeah , that's me . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	That's you . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	We've got trend watching , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	that's you . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	It's uh 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Components design . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Components design . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	. 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Alright . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	So Uh . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	So uh 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	we decide what it's gonna be . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Probably plastic . Uh 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	we need the infra-red transmitter . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Get that off the shelf . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	if you go on to the next slide . Uh 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	If you go on to f uh findings , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	it's like two or three slides down . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Right . So , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Okay . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	this is what I found we can use . Uh 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Okay . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Now , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Cost is 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Do you think ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	W 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	I don't think it would . Um . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	And solar cells , I dunno about that . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Um . Yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Um . And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Uh one is a flat one , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um the materials are tha there as you can see , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41		
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	uh which would be 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Is it not also it's expensive ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	and light . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Uh , i think so as well , yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	They make mountain bikes out of that , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um . Um . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	don't they . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	So it's really light as well . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Curious . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Um . T yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Um could you maybe draw something ? 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I you don't 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	doesn't have to be perfect , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Uh . Well 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Um I don't exactly 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Double curved . It probably means this is probably double curved . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	I guess . Or not necessarily . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	So it might literally just be 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Two curves . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	okay . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Yeah 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	like that . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Whereas this is two curves . Um 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Alright . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Um which obviously 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	it looks better than the single curve , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	but uh you can't have it in titanium , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	which is 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	uh a nice material . Uh 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	So 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	you have to decide , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	there's trade-offs there . Um 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	if you want the buttons to be 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	oh yeah , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	But you're gonna ha 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	So um 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Do you think ? 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Okay , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	that was definitely something we can talk about . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Um so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	So , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	depends where 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Um , do you have any idea so far , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Is that did I 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Well 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I think compared to say just pressing buttons . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yep . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Advanced , like three eight six advance . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay , sure . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	If I've not over-stepped . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	i 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Okay , um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	should I go on , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	or go back ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Well 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Okay , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	that's good point . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	We have to look into the costs of those . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	So , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	sorry . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	If you go to the one before that 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	uh so 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	it just says what it does , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	translate the key press into an infra-red signal 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and this is received by the T_V_ . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Okay . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	So 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	that's just how the control works inside . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	. 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Um . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	. 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	So 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Um conventional battery would seem to make sense . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	and I'm 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I don't know about anybody else , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Okay . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I also have a preference for rubber . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Okay , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	well um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Based on my research . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah , well 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	will we move on to user interface , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	yeah ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	. 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Um sorry , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	as long as were you ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yep I'm finished . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Um and d d d interface concept . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yep . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and the white board 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and pretty much decided to just dump them all . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	I wasn't very impressed by them 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and they didn't seem to re 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Um so 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	what I ra 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um so uh 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	next slide , if you please . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	because if you m 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	so if there's something f 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	digital . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Ah , okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable , whatever , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um box . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	So it's not 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	I'm not really excessively concerned about that . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	You must have two two modes , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Um , so you 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Can I just jump in slightly there ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yes , absolutely . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Um , basi basically what I basically what the what be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	The joystick would be in the right place . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	that it should be , you know , soft to touch 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	and 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	can be moved around all nice . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Um okay 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Um , yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	on to on to the next uh to the next slide . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	'kay basically um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	I can add pretty pictures to this . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	The um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	So . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	You then have a grip section 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	You just have big two big buttons 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Um , and that 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Is this the joystick ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Th this part here is the joystick . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	This would be the actual grip . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	That would be probably the bulkiest part . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	and this would need to be articulated as well . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	So it would fit just nicely in the hand . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And again , this part could be 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	rotated , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Um So 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	and menu mode would be the enter button . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um now 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	programming it 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Programming them can be a right pain . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Um . But uh . Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	That's that's my idea . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Excellent , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	right . Um uh . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Mm . 'Kay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	File open . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	We go . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Trend watching . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Okay . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	So uh 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	to gather my research , two basic methods . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	what's what's the new black , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	you know , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	as it goes . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Next slide please . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	As in they want it to do a lot of good s 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	they want it to look like it does a lot , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	but they don't care so much , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	you know . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	They want it to be 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Technology technical technologically innovative . People want it to be that , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	like the interface is really important . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	And easy to use , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	People want it I is 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	it has to be cooler than easy to use , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	you know , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	How that relates to a remote control I don't know . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114		
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	But I I see 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I come on to that in the next in the next slide . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Spongy . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Well 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	spongy's the new black as well . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	we have the choice between rubber and plastic . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Oh yeah , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I forgot to mention that . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Okay . Okay , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Forgot to say that . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	so 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	kinda spongy material . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	So um so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Okay . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	my personal opinion ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	that looks cool , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	that's that's different , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	you know , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	that's 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	you need something cool . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Like , titanium is cool 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	but it's expensive . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	or we stay totally away from it . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	so maybe it is important 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	for 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	it's the up to the interface guy . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	It could be something like , I say potato peeler 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	I think cool is the key . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Few questions about a spongy remote control . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	I've never seen one before . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I've seen plastic remote controls . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	I think maybe they were 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	I don't know , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	So um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	it doesn't matter , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	it's spongy material , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	it's not gonna break , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	you know . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	how do things fit it ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	you know 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	it's damage resistant and stuff like that , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	so . So 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	just to summarise , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	people want stuff that's cool , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	that's that looks like it's cool , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	and if it is cool then that's a bonus 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	doesn't have to be um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	people like fruit and veg . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	We can either go down that alley 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	or stay totally away from it . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	People like spongy material . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	and how we can further promote that idea . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	And also , this was this year . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	So , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	things change all the time , every year 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	you know 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Well 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	next year something else is gonna be the new black 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	'Kay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Okay . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	That's me . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Well , um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	You always have to bring out new designs , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Um I can see your point about the number keypad , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	but I've 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112		
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	for you to be 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah , actually 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	becau it's 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	you know 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	That's a good point . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	You can incorporate names into the menu . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	So you 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Even news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	So 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	say something like um lithium ion battery , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Looks like we going for a double curved design . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I I would say definitely , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I mean I mean I mean 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	So 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	I can see why it looks appealing , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	That would be a worry of mine . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Mm . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	F if you wanna design it that way . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	. 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144		
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	organic , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148		
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	but uh . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	we won't add that functionality . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115		
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Okay . Course not . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124		
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	However , one interesting point is , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I don't know how serious you were there , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	but we 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Sure , yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I dunno . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	It's an certainly a different colour from your average um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Make it harder to lose , as well . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	That's true . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Sure . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Was there anything in your research 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119		
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159		
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Y you know , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	you lose the monkey the banana , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	monkey . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160		
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	y you lose the banana , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	you press a button , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	I th uh I mean if it 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	though maybe have monkey as default . Um . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	S 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	oh , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	you know 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	you s you click a button 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	and it finds the frequency 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	that works with your particular television . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	I I don't know . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Well basi basically 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	the um for f for uh 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	I mean 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	It's not simply a matter of frequency . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	So um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	and you'll have this little booklet of codes 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	and try the different codes 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	that 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	come under that manufacturer's name 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	'til you find the right one . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah , that's right . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	So 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	that's that's quite annoying 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	and we probably would still have to do that . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Um booklet . Some pages . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	so 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	once every s 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Doesn't have to be used very often 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	that's right , yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	and it's 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	But it's a but it's a nuisance . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	If you if there's w i 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Okay , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	this 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	This is the conceptual one . Um . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	I think we've come up 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I think we've covered everything we need to here . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	we're now looking at the detailed design 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Um So for example , um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	I'll just start at the top , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress . Um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	The user interface design , They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Um well 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	So um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Mm-hmm , that's very true . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Um . Okay . Um 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	got product evaluation as well . Um . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	you see I don't 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	some of these things kinda logically follow the others . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	How can t 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I I think we'd be 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	yeah , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	no , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Oh , that's the okay , sure sure sure . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Um so 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	which I suppose is quite similar . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Okay , sure . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	At this stage we still have no no target audience 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	or 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	'Kay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	something that's stylish , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	And it's stylish . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yep . Okay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Think that's well within the normal bracket . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	That one might have to be based on 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Programmable memory as well . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	The U_S_B_ for which ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	For the remote control . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Oh right , okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	We've w definitely talking some type of 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Um . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	or are we gonna 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	It's just for T_V_ , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	but for 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Different . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Mm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	We don't know unless it would make sense to . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	I mean it's 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Well 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	something that doesn't 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	The other thing 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	the menu system ought to be um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	o ought to be customisable 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	and uh 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Mm-hmm . W 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Sure . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	it is supposed to be international , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	right ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	So . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	It would make sense to . I would say to . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	It would make sense if you could 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	We've already had the five minute warning , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	so . Um . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	I would say yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	International would make sense . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	I'm 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Uh we'll see how that goes . Um . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	So um 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Where is the clay ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211		
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	do 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	would you say ? 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	The fruit and veg . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	This one . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling . 	
ES2003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Mm . I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217		
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Bu but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240		
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187		
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	though maybe we could have options for colours as well . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Sure . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	but we wanna keep the company brand as well , 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	so . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Mm . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	I was like 	
ES2003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Okay . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	And I think that says it all really . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I think so too . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Right . 	
ES2003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	See everybody in a half hour . 	
ES2003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Sa
