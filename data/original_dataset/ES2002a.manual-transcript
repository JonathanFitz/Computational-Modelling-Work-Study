ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . Um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	so we're designing a new remote control and um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Oh I have to record who's here actually . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And you all arrived on time . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Um and so there are three different stages to the design . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	What did you get ? 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Designing a remote control . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	That's about it , didn't get anything else . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Is that what everybody got ? 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Did you get the same thing ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And repeat that process three times . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Um . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So who would like to go first ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I will go . That's fine . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Very good . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Alright . So 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	This one here , right ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . Very nice . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Alright . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	My favourite animal is like 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	A beagle . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And , yeah that they have lots of personality 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and uh be fit and in robust good health . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	So this is blue . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Blue beagle . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	My family's beagle . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Right . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Lovely . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Then they're small cute and furry , 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Right . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Cool . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	There's too much gear . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	You can take as long over this as you like , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Ok oh 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	we do we do 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Ach why not 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Boy , let me tell you . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	We might have to get you up again then . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	I don't know what mine is . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Impressionist . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Can't draw . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Is that a whale ? 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Um , well anyway , 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Allergic to animal fur , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Ah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	so um fish was a natural choice . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Um , yeah , 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	and I kind of like whales . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	They come in and go eat everything in sight . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Alright . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Superb sketch , by the way . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Tail's a bit big , I think . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I was gonna choose a dog as well . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	That doesn't really look like him , actually . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	He looks more like a pig , actually . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Ah well . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	I see a dog in there . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Do you ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Oh that's very good of you . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Now I see a rooster . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Uh . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	What kind is it ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um he's a mixture of uh various things . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um and what do I like about him , um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	That's just to suggest that his tail wags . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	and very kind of affectionate 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	and um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	uh 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	which is quite amusing , so 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	It is . I think it is . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	He only does it after he's had his dinner 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Hmm . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	It's an after dinner dog then . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	so uh 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	maybe . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Maybe . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Right , um where did you find this ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Just down here ? Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	'Kay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Um , can we just go over that again ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Sure . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Uh , so bas at twel 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Alright , yeah . Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	All together . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Like on the shelf . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um I dunno . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	I imagine 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	That's a good question . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Our sale our sale anyway . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I imagine it probably is our sale actually 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , okay okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Alright . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	But I I don't know , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yes . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Think it will ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Oh yeah , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um f frequencies or something 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	regions and stuff , yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	um as well as uh characters , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well for a remote control , do you think that will be 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I don't know . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So , possibly . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Just a chara just a characteristic of the 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Just 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Or just like , basic product podi positioning , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	might not be such a big hit in Greece , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	who knows , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	something like that , yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Marketing . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Good marketing thoughts . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Oh gosh , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I should be writing all this down . Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	something other than just standard . Um 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	so I'm wondering right away , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	isn't it ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Or no , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	is it as much as that ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yep . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I'd say so , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Um , I dunno , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I've never bought a remote control , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	No . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um right , okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Let me just scoot on ahead here . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Thin 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	No , actually . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	That would be useful , though , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	other 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	wouldn't it , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	if you knew like what your money would get you now . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	as you point out , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Oh . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	It just comes along . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Five minutes to end of meeting . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Oh , okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	We're a bit behind . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Do you know what I mean ? 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Like so sort of like how do you 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I know um 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	But 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Right . Right . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So um for them it was just how many devices control . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay so 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Right , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I think so . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Well like um , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	everything , agenda . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	such as the lighting in your house , or um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Oh that's a good idea . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	An 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	So extra functionalities . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	So they w all work actually function together 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	but I have different remote controls for each of them . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	um 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	But each one's got its own little 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	part . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Um okay , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	uh I'd wel 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um I'll just check we've nothing else 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	. Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And you keep losing them . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	You keep losing them . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Mm . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Okay . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Finding them is really a pain , you know . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Mm . Mm . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I mean it's usually quite small , 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	or it's kicked under the table . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	You know . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	That's just really good id 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	There 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Uh , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Dunno . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	sure . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Okay maybe . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	My goodness . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And um , you know , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	when I think about what they are now , it's better , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Still feels quite primitive . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Maybe like a touch screen or something ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Something like that , yeah . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Uh-huh , okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	'Cause it could b it could it could be that f 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	but that just the appeal of of not having 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	It looks better . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Um , nicer materials 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	and might be 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	be worth exploring anyway . 	
ES2002a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Right , well um 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	so just to wrap up 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	so y you know what you're doing there . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Um for user interface , technical functions , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	what it'll actually do . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Um and uh marketing executive , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	And uh 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	and that's the end of the meeting . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165		
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	um , do we 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Uh-huh , yeah . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	right ? 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Well , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	um 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Th 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Okay , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	I I don't know . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	well just very quickly 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	'cause this we're supposed to finish now . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yep . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Um I guess that's up to us , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	so um , you know 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	I think one factor would be production cost . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Because there's a cap there , 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I think that that's the main factor . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Okay . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Okay . 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Alright . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192		
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	So , uh 	
ES2002a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	thank you all for coming . 	
ES2002a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191		
ES2002a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Cool .
