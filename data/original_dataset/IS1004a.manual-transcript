IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Thanks for being here . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um so let's have a look to the the agenda . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So , we are going to go through this agenda 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	It is in three step as you know . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	First the functional design . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	The second's a conceptual design , 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	and then the detailed design . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So who want to start ? 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Mister . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Let's see . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	uh I think I have one in mind , so uh 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	You have one in mind ? 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I'm gonna about the uh spider 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	The spider has a 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	spider lives in a web 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	and uh it has eight legs , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	that little uh 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	well it's actually a book first 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So , that's my animal . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Okay . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Th thank you . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Very interesting . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Guillermo you want to ? 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	'kay 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I dunno why , but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	not a pink panther , 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	or maybe yes . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It would be very funny for us . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Uh yeah yeah . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So bad I don't like it . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Oh . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay it's a friendly panther . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah maybe . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	so but 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I like it because it's fast , 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	and it's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	and it's it's 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	it looks like um powerful , strong , 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	uh I dunno . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay . Thank you . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Hemant . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um sure . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	So you don't like pink panthers ? 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I like it . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Oh yeah . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Thanks . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	This lapel is coming out once in a while . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	It's not very strong . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Okay . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I'll try to draw elephant . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	It's a problem . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay , thanks . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Okay so , elephant goes like this , 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	and then it has four feet . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I think this is the easiest . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	And then we have it's trunk . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	yep something like this . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	An eye , 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	cute . 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah , so 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Poor elephant . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	and sometimes they have a hump . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	That's the way they walk . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And that's very peculiar about them . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	None of the other animals walk like this . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And they are very useful to human beings . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And they are found in um usually the warm countries . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	That's what I know about them . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	There are two kind of uh 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	these elephants who are Indian and 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	So at some 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	for some elephants it's the trunk is having one 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Do we have some message there ? 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yes . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	We have to 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I have to catch you , 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Wind up 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	sorry . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	? Okay , some other time . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	We have to to go through the meeting . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Thank you . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Thank you . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	We can discuss that off-line . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53		
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Thanks . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	so another important part of the project is about money , 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	uh and about 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	so about finances . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and uh we have um 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	And we should target the inter an international market . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So could I just ask one question , um 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay , alright . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	so let's go to it . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Should be should 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Should it be a universal one ? 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And uh etcetera . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	because we have only three three minutes to go . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay well , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Okay . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so it's 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay I think this is more a job to our 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Marketing person . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	market person yeah . 	
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
IS1004a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So we need to close the meeting . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Uh we'll have a new meeting soon 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So um you have to work on the on the working design , 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	you have to uh work on the technical functions , 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , 	
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	alright ? 	
IS1004a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah .
