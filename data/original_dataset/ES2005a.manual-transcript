ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Alright 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	so twenty five . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	So yeah , 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I've 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	and they're fairly basic . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	So uh 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yeah , I was thinking that as well , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	where they're , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	yeah . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Mm . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	So presumably that might be an idea to put into . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Slim . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Mm-hmm , it's about that . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	And that's quite a lot for a remote control . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Mm . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um well 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	As you said they come with the T_V_ 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	so maybe we could think about colour ? 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Make 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Okay . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	you know those things ? 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	The the keyrings , yeah yeah . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Because we always lose our remote control . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Right . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh yeah uh , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Okay , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	that's cool . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	like what is the competition in the market ? 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Okay . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	What speciality other remote controls are having 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Okay . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	like 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21		
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Okay . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	so , yes , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	'Kay . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	all this . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh , what do we think a 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	So , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	we're looking for 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	'Kay . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	What do we think a good size would be for this ? 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	We're 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16		
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Sorry , 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24		
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	carry on . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Then you lose it , yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Okay . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	like , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	For for uh 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	'cause 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	No , I wasn't , no 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	sorry 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Okay well right 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	but 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	we'll have to um I'll 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	we're k having another meeting in half an hour 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	so um 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Okay . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	we should all look into a bit 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	uh , oh actually , no , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	we'll allocate . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So you do the looking around at other remote controls . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Yeah . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . 	
ES2005a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Right . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Which will probably just usurp what I said 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	so 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Yep . Okay . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Uh .

ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19		
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	And you look at competition and design . 	
ES2005a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Yep . 	
ES2005a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Cool . 	
ES2005a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Okay .
