ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	So is 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Why not save that . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Do you want to replace existing file , no . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	And then find it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	spreadsheet . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Yeah , but I've ta uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	right , I'll just re-do it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	That's the easiest way . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Well we've made our prototype anyway . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	We can have a good look at that . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	You pass it round to have a look . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Mm very nice . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	So it is , yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Cherry would be alright actually . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	And it's kinda not really at a kind of 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yeah , yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	we might get a 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Copyright , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	What's this this one ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	What's that one there ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Ah , that's the mute . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Oh , okay . Right . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	For the M_ . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	They're thinking 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Um , the important ones are the volume ones . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	So we made them a bit bigger . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	so you've got the volume in orange on design there , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	and the the channel is in blue . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	R right . Um , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	all these things have cost implications . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	So However , I've now . But um , yeah 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	I'll see if I can find them . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Yeah , sis 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Have 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	So that's where the colour buttons came from . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	An important consideration . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Right , okay so um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	And the second one underneath would be the idea for the 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yes , we'll have the slide-away . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Right , okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Bottom . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	So we've got um detail design meeting . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	So , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	evaluation criteria , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	um and finance , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	But other than that , we got the red apple . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	We got the buttons 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Yes , yes . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . And the and the cost implication . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Right . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	The only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Um , and whether it would uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Uh , that's it . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	This this is a 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	yes , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	this is our presentation of the prototype . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	That's the pr 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	So , there's no redesign . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	So that should uh 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Could we get this on the board just so we can see 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	or do you mean do you have the figures there ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	we should plug it in . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Right . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	'Kay , Alice . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	So , sh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Right . . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	'Kay this should be then . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Have a push button interface . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Okay . W the button supplements . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	But 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So the so the real w the real question then would come in . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Do you make all the buttons 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Well do we'll do it on the prototype , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	O 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	so do two , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	see how much it is . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Everything else is gonna be a standard . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	And then we'd have 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	but according to this , maybe it is . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	So 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	I think you just do one , don't you , for the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	and therefore I mean , what's the op 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	and therefore 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	whereas the rest would be hard plastic . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Mm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	I don't know though . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	I would 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Every design change is uh sound] 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	I dunno , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Okay , um , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	We'd have one special colour 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	and one special button form . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	And if 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	What happened ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	You've just gone off the window into another one . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	It's on the bottom row . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Now , right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Sorry , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So that's nine point one there 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	so we've got some 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	So it 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Well , is it s is 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	no , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	it's nine point seven I've got . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	'Kay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Just give us a bit of 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	So , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	S 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	We should be slightly over our budget 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Well , hold on . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Um , if we 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Okay , that gives us twelve point seven 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	without 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Oh , I see , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	so just take out the special colour for the apple and 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Um , . D 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	You know how you turn that one to a zero , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	we have to have it 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	so you need both of them ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	And go for battery instead . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	That would give you one less . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	We should 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	that would save us one , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	though we'd still be slightly ov 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	But you reckon that 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	And then still have the batteries , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	or whatever they would prefer not uh 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	You know what I mean ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	I think the voice recognition . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	At least . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Remember that was a minimum requirement . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Mm-hmm . Makes sense . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Okay . Right um , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Okay 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	I have a little thing . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	. 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Sorry , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	do you want that back up ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	I just had a presentation to do . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Okay , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Mm-hmm . Mm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Right okay um , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	and also finance , I guess . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Whether it's easy to use . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	so I'll go over here . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Right . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	So if we do a sort of a one 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Okay , well we have a single curve , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	So uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Um , sorry that'd be considered fancy . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Of but I think 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	What Is one false , or is t one true ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	I forgot . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	One's true . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	One's true , and okay . Seven's fal 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	And a four is neutral . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Four is neutral , okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	So maybe maybe a two . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	'cause we haven't got the double curve , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	so we can't like say it's completely true . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Go for one . Yep . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	But it's pretty close . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	We've got almost everything we can . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Okay . Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	So , false is seven , true is one , and 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So uh say about a two for fancy , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	you think ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah , why not not , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	m m maybe nearer three . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Two three . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Well , it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	and we're not going for these options . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	This this is just this is just for like the look . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	so that 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	so sh should we go for a a two on that ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	'Kay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	D yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	But not the kinetic . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	But not the kinetic . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Like the power . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	No . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	'Cause you can't afford that 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	w we took that out too . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	No , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	we c ca 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	we can't afford both . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Alright , so 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Didn't you ? Or 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	So it doesn't 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	It's pretty 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	No 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	may is maybe about neutral 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Maybe a three . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	plus it it it's got something , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	but it hasn't got 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Okay . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Well , wait a minute . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	I would give it more than a four . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Right . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Right , okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	'Kay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	the other functions we've got in are are more at the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Now you're trying to lose one point two , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	S 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	I'm just gonna check my email . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	which would be come from the button supplements category . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	And then it stand the test of time better . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Um , interface type um , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	well plastic rather than rubber . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Okay . But I 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	That that that would make the significant difference . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	You could either 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	you could have it 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	and you'd be looking to take out point two . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	or your special colour at the bottom . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	And that would enable you to to do it . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Ye 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	, I just read the email again 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Well , okay , but 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	It's rubber as it is , yes . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	'cause we've got both the both the um the speech 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	We got we've we've got thirteen point seven 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	and we've got it in at the moment 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	I would've said about a two as well . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Do you reckon a two ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	two or three . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	I'd be happy with a two . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Okay . Two . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Oh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	And the next one is 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	I'll have to get it back up now . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	The next on 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Well , I can just sing about . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Easy to use . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	I would've said yes . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	I would go for a one on that at this point in time . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Okay . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	I would say so as well . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Well , yeah it certainly has some . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Um 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	it's got the cherry and the sponginess . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	. 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	It does , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Yep . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Say about a three maybe ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	I don't know . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah , m um 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Maybe two ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	it was just doing it quite well . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Yep . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	but the moment , as it stands , it's um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I woulda said two would seem reasonable . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	It's a two . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah , this is 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	This 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	that's a bit rough at the minute . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Oh . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Does it fit in with our other other products , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	S 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	What do y 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Um , it depends which way you look at it . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	So we're going for a two , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Maybe a kind of three ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Uh d 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Two or three ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	three ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah , two or three . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Sure . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	And it does have attributes that other products do . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Two ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Aye . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Go for it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Right , okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Two or three . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Two . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	How 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Right , come on . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Two . Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	That's that decided . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Right . So 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	and then 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	What does what do all them numbers mean then ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Do we add them up and rate or anything ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Yeah we s yeah , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I'm just gonna do this in my head . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	About a two . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Two . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	One point eight isn't it or something . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	I think , anyway . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	So yeah , pretty close to a two . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah , so it's 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	So 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Yep . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	So should we get So are definite 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Two b two b two , yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yes . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Okay , so we need to 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Okay , well I put it back on . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	I'm not sure . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	we'll probably have to re-rate it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yes , I would've thought so . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Yeah , yeah 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	we'll make the adjustments 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	and then see how are rates are going . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Okay , so what was it , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Ah it's on . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.193	it's come on already . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Oh . Oh . How kind . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Right , okay . So , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	you can see there that the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214	You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.215	That's right . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	which gets us um In right within the budget range . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Mm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Which gets you 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Yes . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah , I think that'd be fine . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Because that was just a trend , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	and we do have rubber buttons anyway . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	So that's eleven point seven , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Different different colours , yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Alright . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Possibly , yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Um 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Okay , so 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	So we're going for plastic , yes ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221	Yep . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Oh yeah , and that would now be 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.199	And then 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Do we actually have 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	You got special colour . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	and therefore , that was the special colour . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	And we we've we've got we've got enough for another 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	we've got nought point eight left , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	so we've got enough for another 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Well , we've got special form . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Now that would be one button , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Yeah , um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	But the but but but the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Alright . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	So , special colour , you want three in there . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	which I think we should 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	they'll still be fine for the for the price . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.203	'cause it's just two supplements , you know . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.204	One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	That makes sense . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Okay , uh that's probably it . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Okay . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.206	So we only ne we only need two for that . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.207	'Cause I mean these these are moulded . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.208	The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	And we've got special form is the one apple . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	The rest are all standard , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	although you could argue that should maybe be 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	or were you ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Ne uh 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Was that the idea ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	the volume ones should stand out a bit . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Maybe that'll be a second supplement . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah , that 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Then there's a spe a second special form . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245	I would have thought that's probably about r well . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Um 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Well you got you got twelve . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.209		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Okay , so tha 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	So I think that should still be okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah , that's twelve point three , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Right . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	so we're still within budget on that . Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Yep , that makes sense . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Yep . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	I woulda said so . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	That's without 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.213	So shall we do a Well , um 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	And specially it definitely could fits the the real product 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	What was the what's the company name ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Real Reactions ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Real Reaction produ 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	R yeah . Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253	I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	I mean it still seems definitely fit that p 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Yeah , so 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Uh 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Yep 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.217	So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.255	I would s 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Like we got a cherry one . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.220	I don't know . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.221	That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	You mean of 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.222	And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.223	And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.224	I don't know . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.258	because at the moment you're making a red apple . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Yeah so it's a 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Well you could 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.259	So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.227		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.260	Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.261	And that 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.262	amount 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.230	So , we've what have we what have we rid of . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.231	We got rid of the plastic . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.264	we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Is it 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	That yeah , that was uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.233	The rubber . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	that was just about all . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	I think we've saved quite a bit 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.236	But uh 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	I dunno . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	And that is like the most standard type of button . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.237	So I mean , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.238	but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.239	So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.240	So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Well , ease has certainly stayed . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.241	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.243	And what about the sort of innovation ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Do you think 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.245	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.267	And the speech feature . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Yeah , the speech feature . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.246	And then , the corporate identity . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	I think we've cut just about the same . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	We've maybe lost 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Hasn't it 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.268	How it would play out , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Oh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.249	I mean , it's maybe not . I mean 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Um 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.252	Yeah . Okay , well I mean 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	I don't see how we could make it any more . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.253	We cou 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	But then what colour would you make the R_s ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	just the the company logo . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.270	Well , but you've got the company logo on there , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.271	which would effectively be a stick-on badge . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.272	So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.256	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.273	And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Hey , what what what's the company colour ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.258	Did you get told what the company colour is or 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	I'm still not quite sure we've established that . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	No , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	I just 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Don't think so . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	We got the logo off the web browser . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.275	But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.259	Oh right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.276	There's virtually n 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.277	The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.260	Hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.278	so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.261		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.279	Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.280	So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Mm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.281	And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.266	'Cause you've got sort of 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.267	we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.282	You could put in another 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.268	Another colour . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Or would that be t 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.283	Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.270	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.284	Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.285	So you were talking about uh um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.286	We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.272	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.287	Which m may or may not be the case . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.273	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.288	Well , yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Um , I don't think they would really need to be . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	maybe we've m 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Needs to be an enter button , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	but could just be the same as well . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.275	Hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	plus it's hidden away anyway , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	you're not gonna see it at the start . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.276	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.277	I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.291	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.292	well 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.278	So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.279	But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.280	So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Alright . Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.281	'Cause you 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.282	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.293	So we just add that to profitability in effect . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.283	So 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.285	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.299		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.286	I mean so we've dropped the cost , but 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.300	Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.287	Same sort of function ? The criteria ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.288	It's alright . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	'Kay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Just made a load of money . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	go to a three ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.298		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.290	Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.297		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Alright . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.291	le lemon sh 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.292	I think 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.293	well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	On the volume ones ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.296		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Uh , . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Or something like that . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	That's good . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.295		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Definitely lemon shaped . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.284		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.295	Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.296	Or was it the other way around ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.297	Right , okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.301	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	So I think we can we're okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.302	So we're okay this way around . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.298	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.299	So that 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.300	so we've saved 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.303	Until the design team comes in and says , get off . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.301		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.304	But you are the design team . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Then we say it's fine , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	so it's all good . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.302	Saved two Euros on that . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.305	So what bit are we on to ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	And did we make it a cherry officially ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.306	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.307	I th I th 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.303	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.308	Oh . Right , okay . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.309		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.304		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.310	Oh drats , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.311	I've botched that , haven't I . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.305	Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.306	M but it really has to fit into the budget , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Right . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.307	so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.308	Which is fair enough . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	And we seem to have least something in each criteria . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.309	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	We haven't completely left anything out , so 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.310	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.311	I think 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.312	most 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.313	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.314	Yep . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	So do we have anything else to discuss ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.315	I don't know . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.316	What's on the agenda ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.312	Right , okay um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.313	What's happened here ? 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.314	Right , okay um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.315	Mm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.316	Right , okay um , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.317	Right . So we got 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	We've got the closing . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.318	So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.319	So we're now on to project process . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.320	Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.321	So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.219		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.317	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.322	So what did you 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.323	and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.318		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.324	So , um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.319	Finish your meeting now . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.220	We should just go through this quickly and then 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Huh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.320	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.325	So 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.326	I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.327	which I will do . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.321	Okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.328	So , uh I think I have to finish that page . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.322	Oh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.329	Right , okay , so 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.330	Project evaluation . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.331	So , um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.332	Creativity . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.333	Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.323		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.221	Um , yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.334	Well um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.324	I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.335	Individual meetings . How do you mean ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.325	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.326	Well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.336	In you on your own . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.327	and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.328	sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.337	Um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.329	and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.330	You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.338	Mm , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.339	The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.331	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.340	Then you go away . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.341	You find out information . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.342	You then come back . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.343	You then discuss it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.344	You then go and change things around , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.332	Uh-huh . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.345	and then go back . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.333	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.346	So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.223	and then diff things will be relevant . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.347	Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.336	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.348	so it's not uh well uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.335	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.349	Anyway , so , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.350	what do you want to put down ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.334		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.351	I've put , seemed okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.352	Creativity , seemed okay . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.353	Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.337	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.338	Yeah , the thing itself . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.354	Um 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	I can't think of a better example at the minute . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.339	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.355	Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.340	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Is this go 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.225	It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.226	and then something we can at least look at 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.227	and think how we can improve on . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.341	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.356	You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.342	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.343	But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.344	I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.345	I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.346	but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.347	that's , you know , fifteen quid . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.228	one of those things . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.357	I th I uh d 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.230	I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.358	But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.359	I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.348	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.360	um for um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.361	you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.362	and find out information to see how to get it fixed . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.349	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.363	So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.364	And then you 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.365	or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.366	show them where to 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.367	either give them directly give them help , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.368	or secondly , point them in the right direction , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.369	either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.370	So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.371	because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.372	And of course , you had the machine crashing 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.350	Hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.373	and various things going wrong . So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Well , sh we look at the last slide , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.351	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.233	see if it's got anything else . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.234	I think there's one one more to go . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.374	Alright , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.375	so we've got uh 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.352	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.353	I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.376	New ideas found , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.354	And 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.377	did we find any , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.378	no . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.235	It was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Like , that's something that made it a little easier . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.380	Alright . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.355	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.381	Leadership , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.382	teamwork . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.356	we did find a new idea , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.357	I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.358	I've never seen one of them before . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.359	batteries , I think . So 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.237	voice recognition , especially not could 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.383	Does 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.360	Mm yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.384	You've got voice recognition computers , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.385	that's not remote controls . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.361	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Well it's a different application of it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.386	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.239	Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.387	Okay , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.362	Mm . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.388	so how do you reckon teamwork went ? 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.363	That went okay , yeah . 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.241	Yeah , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.242	I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.364	Mm-hmm , yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.365		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.390	To uh go uh reasonably well . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.391	Okay . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.369	I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.392	Bit bit arbitrary . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.370	Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.371	I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.393	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.372	and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.394	So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.373	Surely they they should produ 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.395	And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.374	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	because you are the Project Manager . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	You were the leader . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.389		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.366		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.375	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.376	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.396	Now , I'd much rather be in marketing 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152		
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.367		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.397	but 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.398	I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.368		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.399	However , um 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.400	Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.377	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.378	It worked . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Yeah , very nice . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.379	Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160	I mean , they record what you're writing , 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	and then what do you do with it ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Where do you get the recording ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Do you plug the computer or something ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.380	I think there's a little there's a little um chi 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.243	So it's not just for us , 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.244	it's for the experiment as a whole , so 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.381	There's a little there's a little chip , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.382	I think you must plug it into something 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.245	Should we quickly look at the last slide ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.383	and it produces a 	
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Sh 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Right . 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	I think you watch a video of it kind of . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.384	I don't know . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.385	Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.386	and Page after page . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.401	Right . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.402	New ideas found , so one or two . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.387	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.388	Kinetic powered remote control . Um , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.389	what was the other one ? 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Voice um recognition thing . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.390	Vo yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.403	um and uh voice 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.391		
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.404	uh , was it voice activated um 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.392	Voice recognition , yeah . S 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.405	recognition . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.393	Almost . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.394	To fill in these fill in these questionnaires 	
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Pretty much . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.406	Right , so , 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.396	Oh no . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.407	uh are the costs within budget , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.408	yes . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.409	Is the project evaluated , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.410	yes . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.411	Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.412	Then celebration . 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.395		
ES2014d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168		
ES2014d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.247	. Is that everything ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.397	Hmm ? 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.398	I think that we've got two questionnaires 	
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.399	and a report on the last meeting . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.413	Yeah . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.414	Uh , so we don't re 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.415	So really 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.416	I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.417	and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.418	Mind you , the the figure last was was different , 	
ES2014d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.419	but it should be poss
