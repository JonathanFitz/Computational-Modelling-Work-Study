IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	So we are here for the concept design meeting . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	We'll then t take decision in concert 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So now uh we will have three presentations . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Abdul al-Hasred is my name . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	okay . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	So this is the presentation . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Uh , I_D_ you want ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	I only v have three slides , so . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I just look at the mm um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	And um 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	yeah we can change directly . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	The push button are usually extremely cheap , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Mm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I I th 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	But I don't think that uh we should 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Also have to say 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	But 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Um that's all 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	No ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	You received something 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I haven't chec 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Says 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	But I guess it could be 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And could it be adapted ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I guess it's possible . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	so if they already have it as uh as a chip 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	then we we could use it . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	but I think it's yeah 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Sorry , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	I haven't written my personal references . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Um 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and if we could reduce that . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I have a question about that actually . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um , what is the purpose of the light ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Is 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	But 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	But in th in the dark uh 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	no ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	You can see the buttons better , of course . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . True . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah . Actually . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	but you need another sensor for that , right ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . Again . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	no it's too expensive . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I don't think that this is really expensive , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Extra . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah , okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	To have the light always on ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah , a little bit . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	A little bit . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Well we will discuss that after maybe 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	the other presentations . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	. So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	It was last time I saw it . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	And it is . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	just move to the next slide . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So basically want very simple , right ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	That's the major idea , as simple as possible . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um . So . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And also does it uh fit well in hand ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	so go to the next page , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	so . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	and on the left one is exactly the same . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	yeah ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	These are the basic thing . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So it's only the central part . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	if you have , for example 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It could be on the right side , for example . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Okay . S 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So that they're separate a bit , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Will be down or 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Alright , you won't yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	That you want to protect a bit . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	And I think it's uh it's reasonable . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So , I don't think 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah , this is just the the wheel . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	We could use the 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	To s 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Okay . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So we can move to the 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Is there any question ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	For designer of user interface ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay , I can go ? 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Can I ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Okay . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	And um so you you can go 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	after . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	something like that , or 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	I support an apple . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Uh I don't know which material can be spongy , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	and if you 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	This is good also for 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Well , wou wou 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	it it would work , right ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	You can throw it to the television . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah , because it's robust . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Okay 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . Me too . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	It's robust , yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Hey 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	that's a cool one . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	When it d uh takes a shock . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Not good . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	uh sorry ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Ah it's okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I know that they do that for alarm clock also . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	An and and uh this uh you can 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	yeah you can say that . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	You ca uh you can go uh before 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	No . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Before ? 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	, before , yes 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	. And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah that's why 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Has it ? 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Innovative . Mm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	How do we make it look cool is the question . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Cool , fancy ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114		
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	What about um 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Oh , colour , yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Oh i i 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Maybe yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I thought about a a pear , for example . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	and it's ergonomic as well . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	and uh 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	A pear . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	The banana is also ergonomic . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Or a fruit like that . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	I dunno . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	We can discuss that uh . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	D D Is is there anything you want to add ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Is there any fruit that is spongy ? 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I don't think so . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Something like that . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	with blue L_E_D_ inside ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	But that's not in the trend . . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	You can make it um 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	It's not hard , the metal . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Plastic . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yep . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	So , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I think we can keep the wheel 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	wit uh any others idea you have . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Mm . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Odi 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Banana I think , 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	it's a nice idea . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Because 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	But 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Two of the button , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	and here you have a a push button to 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	But you don't have 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I think it's a good idea , yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	yeah , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So you can have it on on two sides 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	and it'll be cool , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	no ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Maybe we can keep the banana . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	And it will be very easy to find . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	You can put also vibrator inside . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And everybody knows what is a banana . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Basically . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Ah-ha . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Oh , yeah 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah it's really uh really a good point . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	I hope the students of management die , 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	but anyway . 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Now who are recording this meeting ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	I think it 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	So 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	One second . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So we have to take some decision on this aspect . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	So , uh so for 	
IS1001c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57		
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	sorry , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	for uh component , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	so 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	we have to think about those aspects , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	sorry . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So we will just use a a standard battery ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And uh the chip we 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Uh what do you mean by case ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156		
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	The only th 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Spongy also . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	right ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So , it's going to be bend a lot . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	So if we try to push the buttons , it 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Oh no I think it's possible . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	But 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	You think it's possible ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	No the button would be 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Okay . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	. This is uh like the 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Okay 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	odd shape with spongy cover . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	And standard battery okay , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	So we agree to put the wheel 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Wheel on the top . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Button , where do we want some buttons ? 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Well , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	usually hold 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	right ? 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Uh 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	So it have to it has to be symmetrical . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah but 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Sa let's say that th o 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	It has to be 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	basically you can only take two sides , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yep . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yep . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161		
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Basically . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Or you could use use this one , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Should have the two sides . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So if the left , we have 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	the op 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I think you can turn it this way also . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	You can do both with both hands . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Wheel 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Wheel buttons . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	I think it's okay . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So you cannot see them . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Well , you you will get used to it . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Y 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah I know , 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	No 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	you you 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	I think for lefty it's okay . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	I can do this movement , 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	and for righty as well .

IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side .

IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	and uh a wheel on the top . 	
IS1001c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1001c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So the colour is yellow . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	I think it's uh 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	So maybe we can um 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . 	
IS1001c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users ,
