ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yep . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yep . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Alright . Okay , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	so first let's go through this PowerPoint . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	I wonder what button I press ? 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Just do it on the arrow . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	or how about I just click ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay , here is our project . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Same thing with conceptual design . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	That's pretty much the the whole process for today . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . Alright . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	First we're gonna start off by using our tools . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	We could 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah , we could on here . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Alright , let's go forward then . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Even if you are not a good drawer like me . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Alright . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Artistic skills , nil . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Fine . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Oh , thanks . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Bless you . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	I draw like I'm in grade five . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Oh do I . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'Kay , about one more minute . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	And who would like to start us off ? 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I'll go . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Alright . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Um this is my picture . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	I drew fish 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	It's pretty cool , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	and um they've got a pretty good habitat 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Only if they're piranhas . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	they they're easy , you know . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Alright . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Who wants to go next ? 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I'll go . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	I drew a kitty . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	but I love cats . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	No I I see it . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	No , I kne I knew . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	No , it looks like a cat . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah , it does look like a cat . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I love cats , too . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I'm a cat person . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I'm allergic to cats . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Ah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Uh . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I'm allergic to cats , too . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Oh , okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	If you're around one 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	In my next life . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	it's weird . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I still can't sleep with them in my room . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Okay . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Oh , yeah , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It was crazy . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay , Fenella ? 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um , I drew a badger . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Cool . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Badger . Good choice . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Well , yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Why a badger ? 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Uh 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I dunno , 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	they're grumpy and nocturnal and 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Are you trying to suggest something ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Well , a little bit like the Yes . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um . And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Oh , okay . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	He's Liverpudlian writer . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Alright . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um , that kind of books . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Badgers are cool in that one too . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	And I'm last . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	No , that's good . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	No , no , no , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	but whatever . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	They're just such odd creatures , you know . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Only seen a couple in zoos . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . Alright . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Guess we're getting straight back into business here . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	So we're gonna talk for a little while . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	anything that you can bring to the table for this project . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Now ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	You wanna start us off ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Anybody have anything to offer ? 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	right ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Right . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	One remote for everything . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ? 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Right . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah , TiVo . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	TiVo . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	But it's still there , so 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	if po if we're gonna do it 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	They're never universal . That's right . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Something from Sam's club . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	'Kay , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	They want the ergonomic ones . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	They want like the flashy lights . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Oh like this came from Las Vegas . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	But at the same time are simple . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Mm yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Right . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So that people like my mother can use it . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	'Kay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Just bad ones . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . That's true . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	What kinda battery would we want to use ? 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Because battery changing is usually 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	D 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Double A_ . 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Double A_ . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Do some of them use triple A_s though ? 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah some use triple A_s . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Some but 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So double or triple ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah , 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	I guess then it's 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay . Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	But that has to do with the size of it too . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Right . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Well , w as long as we know that issue is 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah , 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Here we can 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Triple A . 	
ES2010a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Can you with a small lithium battery ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	But 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Hey . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Anything else ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Alright . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Moving along . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Oh , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	we're closing the meeting . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Here's what we're going to do . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Um the I_D_ , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	which is who ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay , 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	you're going to think about the working design . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	What do you think that means ? 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , 	
ES2010a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Right ? 	
ES2010a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Right . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I would think so . Okay . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? 	
ES2010a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Okay . This meeting is officially over .
