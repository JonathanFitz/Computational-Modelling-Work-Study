TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hello . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hey guys . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hi . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hi . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Hi . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I see my bunny is still standing . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	No one drawing it . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	It's too beautiful . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Yeah , true . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Uh I figured uh that much . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Too wicked . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Mm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	A minute please , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	my uh laptop is uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	oh , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	there it is , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	thank you . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	So 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	welcome back . At the functional design meeting um 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	I will uh take minutes 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	uh I had an email from the from the management board 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	but there were four points 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	uh which uh I think are very important . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Uh second one is also important 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Uh and uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	So , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	we have uh forty minutes , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Tim , can you start ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yeah ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	'Kay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	welcome . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	which I will show you . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um one hundred respondents were involved 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um , we have three audiences of 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	two audiences , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I'm sorry . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Mm and some interests from the from the age groups , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	I don't think that's uh really appropriate . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	third findings . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um , persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Switching channels , um yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	that's pretty uh pretty normal , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	that's what you do with a remote control . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um the second , teletext , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	uh and the third , uh volume controls . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	So that that's strange . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Yeah , okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	So uh , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	when you ask people , what do they use , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	That's ridiculous . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	That's a ne i it 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	It's a new technology , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but it's not incorporated right now . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	my personal preferences . Um , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um , yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Um second point , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	that's a cool idea . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	where you can put the the remote control in . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Uh not not the r not the functions , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	what what are you think about ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Uh , the funtionability . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	but if you don't use them , yeah it's 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Ah okay , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	so focusing more on the used buttons . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	they have to be on it 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	j just to t to get it done if necessary , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah , perhaps . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Just for the minor functions perhaps . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Thank you . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Yeah , ma perhaps , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	just just an idea . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	'Kay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	that's it . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Thank you , Tim . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Janus , can you uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Right uh , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Well uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	and um I viewed how how they w looked , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	how they worked , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	uh what kind of components are involved , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and how they are connected together . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and how we could uh build one 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Um right . Uh well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	not like all probably know . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	and those uh have a transmitter 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	that's also focused on infrared , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	so that would mean extra cost for the user 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	and thus uh that's 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	so that would probably uh mean lower costs 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	and uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	i 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	that could mean for us a good thing 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Well uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	it may be possible , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	but that's not for me to decide , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	F 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	although 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	actually I have t 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	So it's in the wrong product . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I dunno , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	maybe uh maybe something to look into , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	But it may be uh may be something to explore . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Uh first you have the energy source . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	uh that you can find anywhere . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	I figured that would be best , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	there is a switch uh between these . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	When the switch is pressed in a w on this 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	this case it switches a button , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	displaying to the user that something has happened . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Or I press button 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	so is is something wrong or something . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Uh w well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	the signal goes via chip 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	and then it's processed 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	and then it's sent to the infrared bulb 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Uh well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	my personal preferences here , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	just like you said 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	uh well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	the most users n 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	uh you have a lot of buttons 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	and you u u use you don't use them , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	So uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	no input from the television . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	So 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	and so 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	So 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	and 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Um , yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	maybe another problem uh , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yes , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	but what should we uh s I I I f 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	I agree with you , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Huh . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	'Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Um , well 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	we should uh look into the design and the functionability . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	or well uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	And uh don't overbuild , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	but we we should stick to the basics . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	So that was my uh my personal opinion . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	And that was my uh my presentation uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Okay , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	thank you Janus . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Yes , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I can go ahead . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	You do ? 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	The last presentation . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Last presentation . Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	You have plenty of time , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	so uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	take your time . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	warn you . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	so tha that's that's some of the main points . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	so use as as little functions as possible 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Hmm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	but s I don't know in how far that is possible , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Hmm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	since we are sticking to uh um infrared 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and and the remote cannot receive anything , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	but uh we might uh consider that . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Um well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	of course I I hope this is all clear to you . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	If you 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	you can use remote like this with all the functions , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	many functions , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	but Well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	You have to be very careful what you push , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	from 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	uh um yeah well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	where is it ? Where the hell 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	he here I guess 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So just keep it simple , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	make clear buttons , easy to use . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	that's very important . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Um well 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	this was because of our last discussion , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but um it's no longer uh applying . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Well yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I prefer to use it only for T_V_ 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and um n uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	not to give too many options 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	so uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and so that's where the difficulties lie . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	you you want to keep it simple , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	but 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah . Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	this 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	but 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Okay . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	or do we want to use um many buttons . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	So um 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	weighing those factors . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Hmm 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	that in the middle are the the main keys , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	like displayed on the 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Uh yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	The doesn't . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	. 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah , this ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	No ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah . Something like that . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	but when all the questions I had 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Mm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Uh so 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	that's my recommendation , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Nah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_ 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	is too complicated for most users . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	I think so too , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	but 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	but 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah , that will be a problem . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	or they have a very simple menu structure , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	so 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yes . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	And that would be uh a considerable problem . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	So 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Use big clear buttons . Not too many . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	but I think i this is more important . Um 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Not embed 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	And yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Not first change menu options or switch something . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Um , well yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	as you already told , give some feedback . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	And um , well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	keep it simple . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	So uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	on t 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	some you you'll never know 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	uh and never use , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	and therefore it's uh important 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Yeah . Uh , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	um and that's a big ad advantage I think , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	It's uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	very visual intended . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	What was I to say more ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Maybe that's an option . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Um keep the primary buttons visible . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	and maybe use a touch screen , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	The extra functions . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	The extra functions , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	but l like menu functions or 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	and then all all the options will become available 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Ah okay . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Well um 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	then I'd like to make a proposal . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145		
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164		
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	If you make one big touch screen , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yes . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	use the same concept as here , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	keep the buttons always available 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah , yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yes . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Uh uh I think that will be great . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Jirun ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Okay , I agree , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	but I think it's very important 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	that they always um make the same buttons accessible , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah , of course . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	And so um an elder designer picks up th the of 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	like building in uh some kind of PIN code 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	but children 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	uh if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Yeah 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	wh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Is that possible to use or no ? 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	That is possible , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	that 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	well 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Th there's just 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	that actually depends on the television , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	but I think I figure that would be 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Well , yeah well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	does it have to depend on the television ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Well , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	y you s you see the fi uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	the the channels are different on each te television , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	they aren't set in a preset order , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	so uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	and uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Yeah , th that kind of stuff , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yes . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	that's uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	vi violent channel , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Oh , something like that . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yes . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	uh m my ki my kids uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	I don't want my kids to watch that , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	then you set the priority to only parents , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190		
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	b but make it a separate option in the menu , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	for example . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	that would b 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	But 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah , that . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Yeah okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	but but yeah , that's just 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	so uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	that's an a an added feature . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	parents uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Okay . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	But let's not uh go too wide about the those things , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	that's that why we're here . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	th th those things are nice . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195		
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	It's it's a nice idea , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	but I think that's we wel later in the stage . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	I've one little question about um a total touch screen 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	or uh um a p 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Partial . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	yeah , a partial , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	you can de display it on the on the old style . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	that's just as e just as easy . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Uh . I I do 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Uh I do agree , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	or when you touch a button , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah , it's different . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	W we are aiming for younger people 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah , that's true , yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	and they they chose 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	age b below forty . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	So that's that's probably uh a 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	so 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Mm Yeah . Okay , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I th I think we can do that too . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Done . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Uh so that can be uh can be read out . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Moment . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Ooh . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	uh with uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	we must keep it simple , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	but have the opportunity to uh have more options 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	and have them uh hidden or something , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	or uh um and uh 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	so you must uh the the the 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	I think that's the point what uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yes . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	we discussed . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah , yeah , some of them . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Well 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	but that's not possible . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Mm-hmm , mm yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	from 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	the capable from the t 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	but you have uh uh an 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Add th that that's an opportunity . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	yeah , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	but you have an international market range , 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	so you have I think a big range of 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Well 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	there are universal d um um remotes 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Okay . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	But they 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	But 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	And it's not too complex to do it . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181		
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Well 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	No . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	and that that is bit of a tricky job . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	I actually use one of those 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	when 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah . Well 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Mm-hmm . Oh um mo 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	and that's well 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	No no no . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	no , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	you can just say uh the c 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	He he he he me he means just just one other thing . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Just build it in . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yes . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	You look up , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I have a Philips H_ fifty five 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	and it says press code four five five 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	and it displays all your uh menu options . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Oh , yeah yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	sure , that would be possible , yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Memory in the in the remote . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Yep . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Profiles . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	so that if you 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	yeah , like profile , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	the memory uh pops up the options . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Okay . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	No , that wouldn't be uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Yeah , a few variables . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yeah , well um 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	so uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	I think uh it is possible . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Ah it is . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	It is definitely po 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	We have five minutes to go . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Well then you have to buy a new one , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	it's very good for marketing 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	New remote ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Maybe , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	or an update , software update . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	A firmware upgrade or something , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Firmware update , you say . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Yeah , firmware upgrade . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	but from where ? 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Ah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Maybe w 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	That's maybe the cup holder . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	No m may no , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Well , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	the most most people have , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Well , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	but not not everybody 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	at 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	uh you can go back to the shop 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	and 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	and uh they 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	like a s kind of service centre . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	ser o 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah , maybe something like service cen 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	and they can download it for you . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Well 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Well 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Receiving . Oh yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	we could actually look at into it , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	but I dunno , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Difficult . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	and 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah yeah , uh s I think some I think it's good idea , yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	It's it's it's not a lot of work , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	just one uh docking station where you put it in , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	press start , bling bling , updated . 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Yeah , that would be best , yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Okay , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	No no . Exactly , so 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Um m for which one are we going ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	My mistake . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Let's vote . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	That one or uh 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Yeah , 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	my vote goes out to the right . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Your vote and your 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	My vote too .

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	And your vote ? 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Well , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	I was uh doubting about which one to take , 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	but uh you've convinced me 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Opens up 	
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	Flips open . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	is too difficult 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	or uh 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Uh too difficult , 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	um maybe uh it's easier to break it . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	N yeah . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Break it , I don't get 	
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Yeah ,

TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	It's very sensitive . 	
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Oh so Yeah . 	
TS3007b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143		
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too .
