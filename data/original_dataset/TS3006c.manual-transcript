TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Hello . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	. 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yes , I made it . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	English from now on . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Drawing or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Yeah just testing . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Mm ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Just kidding . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	English . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	So annoying . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Break is over . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Ooh it works . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Whoo . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Spicy . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Spicy . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Where are are all the other presentations ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	The conceptual or 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Ah . Because I see only my own presentation 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	What or whatever does it 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	No no no , 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	can you go back one ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	yeah components design , that's it . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	This ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I'll just put it in there . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	So , he's coming . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	. I did get a bit more done than the last time , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Or not . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Ah , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Ah . She . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	You can look at the final report , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Move to meeting room . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Oh . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah me too , . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	I I've got the same problem as well . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Here we go again . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Welcome . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Thi 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So who wants go . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yes . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Who wants to start ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yes ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Me first again or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Oh . No . Yeah . No problem 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	yeah . Alright . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Did you open it already or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	No . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	no . Ah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Ah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yes . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um this time about trendwatching . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Uh it shows a number of developments . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh I will address them uh in a moment . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um well 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	So um the developments I will address them 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So to give you an idea . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um well the developments ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Uh development one . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh well 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Sound . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	so I don't expect that to be a problem . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah yeah uh uh . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Um 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So um that kind of gets you this ratios . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So my point of attention is especially this part . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	That this will be a crux . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So that was the marketing uh presentation . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I had only one document left . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	And shall I go first ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	So I 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	That's 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	So kind of this 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah yeah sure . No . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Do you want to go first ? Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	So a k a small example . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Kind of this this look . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	I dunno . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Just made a quick design . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Cool . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	It's better than than my uh drawing . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Alright . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Alright . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Yeah okay but I have to design the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Uh components . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah layout . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Oh no . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . It's okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	You probably opened it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah true . Um 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	F_ five . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	F_ five . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Alright . So 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I'm dealing with the components design . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um let's see . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	That's why I had to , wanted to go first . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	There is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	The basic battery . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Uh we have a hand dynamo , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	And uh of course solar cells . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Wi an indoors . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So uh my 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Oh . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Calculator's can do it . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So that's not cool either . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So um 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Or the double curved . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Uh the case materials . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	I would definitely go for rubber 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um poo , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	this is a lot of text . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	I wasn't able to organise this yet . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	We have yeah several uh interface designs . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Yeah . Pushbuttons . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So that's not really interesting . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Electronics ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . I think this is about it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	As an optional uh feature . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Or combine uh both with a with one uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	I guess we can only choose one . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah maybe we 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . And it's more fun . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I didn't receive any info uh . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	And it's also more fun yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I always chuck my uh remote control around , so 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah , just playing with it 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	and especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	S yeah it's safe . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And throw it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah y exactly . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	so it's a perfect combination I guess . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So that's the end of it . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Uh go ahead . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	'Kay next . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So double curved is like this , this , this , or 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	No it means curved in two dimensions . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Mm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Also in in height ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Can we uh 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	We were going to use that . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	So um 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah um 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Design ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Well the visual representation is not there with speech 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	but you can 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Just yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah with the programme . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Both . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	For for everything , 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	also for the advanced options ? Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Everybody says it so that's what's uh 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	yeah um 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	That's yeah obvious . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Um yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	design has to be very attractive 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	but that's your your op your yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	you have to uh delete this 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	but this is the the the simple uh layout . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	That would be the back . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	I'm 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	The back . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Back and okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Back and okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Back and okay yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	You did read the minutes I wrote ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	What ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	You did read the minutes I wrote ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	A little bit I think but not not everything w 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Oh okay 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Oh I uh didn't read that . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I hate doing work for nothing . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	But 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Um 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I wanted to to categorise everything . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Um that was it . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	That was it ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Okay . Uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	again . Ugh . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	No . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Uh the case would be doubly curved . So 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Rubber material . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And rubber . Rubber material . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Rubber material . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	And that's the only thing we have left . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Oh okay . No it's easy . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So that's uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	is that is that the advanced chip ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Advanced chip . Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Wow . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Alright . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Kinetic . Double curved . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Too . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	to be able to m 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Uh I didn't get any info on this . So 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	That's gonna be difficult huh ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	I have total here . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah I don't know . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I didn't get any information about that so 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	. 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Child labour man , we love it . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , so it's cheap . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Who doesn't . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Um well the interface type supplements . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah the interface , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	maybe can 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Ooh . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	No . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Um let me see . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Wait a sec . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	If you go to your homepage or something , you should 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah I'm going there now . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	get your own information . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Inspiration . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Ah you didn't draw it yourself . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Well 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	No . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Ah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Too less time . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Um 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah , also the menu . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	yeah maybe it's 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah that that w 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Maybe it's easier 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Arrow . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Arrow yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . Yeah perfect . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	'S the target group . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	S yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Oh yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah sure . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	It's like really basic . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	This is what we're looking for . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Oh okay . I see . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Not only like this but it has to be 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	exactly . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	But it has also to 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	It ha 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	. 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	The children's story . Yeah I've got it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Distinction . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	And 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	The colour 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	you know , with the 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Mm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Maybe we should consider this function . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	To customise it and so 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Different . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	like uh for example this uh photo th camera . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Camera . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . Cool . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	S underwater uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah submarine . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Personally I think it's really ugly . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Just give me the thing that it's inside there 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	maybe I'm too old for this stuff . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Very cheap uh cheap look . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah but this this the is for the . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	So those I think are all my 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	oh . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Ah yeah bright colours . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	That's singly curved . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	That should be nice . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Well we could make a compromise between that . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	But I don't know if it's worth the effort . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	A compromise between what ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	So s 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	This , this would be uh single curved uh ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah there's only in in this dimension . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Like this . So curvy or not . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Also . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . Exactly . Exactly . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah that would be an option . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	I don't know what you think . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	I think the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	I mean our aim is to make something different right ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	To make something new . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	I would go for the double curved . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah I'd agree . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Well this is really your decision but 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . As well . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	You can make a trigger button or something like that . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Something to shoot at your television 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	or that that is the confirmation button or something , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	That's 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	That would be a nice way to use it but 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Different . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Stands out . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So from top view it looks kinda like this . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	can turn it maybe . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	A little upwards . So that the screen is more 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	How about 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	So then you have double double curved in some way . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Oh . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Something like that . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	And the buttons are more , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	well it's very thick now but 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah I understand what you mean . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	That's uh that's 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	If you can uh flip . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	And then if you want 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh so you have a the the side view . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah . Something like that . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	But I dunno if that's too expensive . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So and you want to be able to 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	I mean maybe it's too much 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	make this 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	No uh like 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	I would draw it like this . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Let's say this is the side view . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	If you know what I mean . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	So that it would come up like that . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Oh the advanced buttons . Right . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	That's 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	But you you want 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	okay . You just want to hide them all ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So w w 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	The oh . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	And the menu button also because when you flip it open 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Oh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Activate and th the yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Why ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	You could just make it mechanical . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	True . True . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	You know a simple uh with a 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	That's 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	but it's it's not 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . Exactly . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	True . It uh c it can go open . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	If you cover it with rubber . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Mm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	And 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Exactly . Exactly . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . So it can bounce . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah , uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	It's very no it's very strong . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Th it's very solid yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah okay so that that may work . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	That actually will offer some extra protection for the 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	What kind of 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	it this is your th 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Harder . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	so maybe you should try it over there . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	With your uh wrist . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Uh yeah . Yeah of course . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Maybe can design two versions . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	But that's that's very expensive uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Like like you drew here . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Give it 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	And ergonomical shape . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	I would give it a female shape 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	but uh yeah . Anyway . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	The female shape yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	With two uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Obviously . Make it more appealing to guys . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	I mean 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Oh yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Some uh k esk uh yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	and so if you 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	I mean , we have to make 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Some 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah we we better so choose one 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	And also the screen , you cannot mould it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	You know kind of thing . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	No no no no . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	But that's the kind of the idea , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	so it lays good in the hand , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	And then you can 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	and then on on the side with with your thumb , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	You can place the screen here , which can come . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	you you can you can use , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	yeah , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	you can use the button option 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226	And but then I w I would 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Spongey . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Spongey can be reached by means of 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	so that 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I Uh y eah that's what I mean . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	No the arrow's over here . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	The arrows over here , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232	and here the s simple uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	and then numbers . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Buttons . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . Alright . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	I think that uh it's a nice design . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	It's cool . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I dunno . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah that's 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	we could make 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Like some soft green or something ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Orange or something . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Or and then 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Or blue ? Dark blue or 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Oh yeah yeah , dark blue 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	We should use 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	with very uh bright tones I guess . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Mm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	So you have something like 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	If you we uh yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Mm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Huh cool . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	No it's 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	. 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Oh . What's this ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah it's text . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Right . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	N no you have to exit . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Hm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	You could also make line with uh 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	So that's 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . Two hours further . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	thickness . Oh . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So that's blue . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Mm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . That's what I call painting . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Y 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	and then on top of that . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	It's pretty nice . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	And then uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Oh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Some yellow . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah with some some yellow banana 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Banana colour . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Like . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Like you have on the Samsung , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	well I don't like to call brands phones , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	the you know that 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	or 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	How do you mean ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Um 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Some some 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah . Exactly . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Well I think it's a bit too much but 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Maybe a 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah an orange . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	So uh yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Who ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	And then you can use yellow or semething . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Why not ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Aye . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Mm . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	So that people with uh with 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Like this . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	White backlight , and dark . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Dark uh letters , yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Whatever which is visible . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	And also for people who are a bit colourblind . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Colourblind yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah . True . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	No so that's mostly red and green I believe . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	That's adjustable . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Woah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Why adjustable ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	All all buttons ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah ? Or not . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	No uh 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Or is it uh too expensive ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	It's difficult . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	And if the background is very dark blue 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Blue . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Maybe green . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah you can 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Like the pictures I showed you guys . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Mm-hmm flashy . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	So more like 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Mm bzz . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Doesn't work very well . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Uh . More like this colour . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Yeah something like that , something that stands out more . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Mm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Red maybe . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Black . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	It's it's not 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	The green ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah . I dunno . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Why ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	So 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263	It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	It's it's trendy okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	But 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	My couch is in that colour . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Mm . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Ooh . . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Well it works pretty well . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	And then time was up . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Uh not yet . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Do you get a pop-up if we 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah within five minutes yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	That you have five minutes left or 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Alright . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	So something like this . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	That should be pretty nice colour . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267	No 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Because the of the green . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	that's actu 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	They have LEDs but they have a colour . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.270	They will see one of each as grey . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271	But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272	I think . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	So red buttons are okay ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	I think so . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	You can make them red . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	How do you mean ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay . Yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	'Cause you have to print on them you have a background 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	No that's that's too busy I guess . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Each number is transparent . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	So you can't 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	change the colour so 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	So just an extra 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Bit of light . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274	You can 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	bit of light and attention . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.275	what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Bit of feedback . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	So that the whole button will shine 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277	as the colour the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Okay with 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Don't mean to discourage you 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Next thirty minutes to design something so 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Ah , right . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Alright . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	And the 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	You will do the evaluation . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Of the product ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Which we don't have yet . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah uh about 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	So wh how should I do that ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Yeah I don't know . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Oh okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	You probably get a mail . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Or you you or you send it to me . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Or just 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	because you are going to design it on this board right ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	I don't know . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	so I make another presentation I guess .

TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	I've a basic idea . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	And you two uh are going to do this . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah .

TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Okay . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Then we have to uh see something which we can uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Alright . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	show to the management . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Shall we uh make a new uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	I would yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	l let's just uh delete all these uh or 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Next . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	. 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Yeah , I just make a new one . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Oh , next . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Alright . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Oh and save this uh board . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Huh ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Just save it . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah okay 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	but just press save and uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	It'll be fine . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	On the left . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	S so , yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Uh sorry . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	You can also include clip-art . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Current colour ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	So if you'll rather draw in paint or something 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.297	So um 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Okay . Uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Because I I 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	then look . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	This ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.301	So how it's gonna look . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.302	And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Uh pretty accurate . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.303	So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yep . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	You can also include it . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	It's not much work . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Light only button user ca user interaction . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Oh no it's it's okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.306	so we kind of want the girlish 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	That's included . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.307	figure . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.308	I'm not so good at drawing . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Excuse me ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.310	No uh uh . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Maybe you should draw it very large like this . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Sensitive . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Oh right . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.312	How do we uh uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Erase ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.313	or insert text ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	I dunno . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Maybe just start typing . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.314		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	It's a bit uh large . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.315		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.317		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	You also do the other sides . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Yeah . Ex exactly . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	. 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Uh 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Uh . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.321		
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.322		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Jesus . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.324	What do I write down ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Much easier , yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.321	'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Mm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.328	No 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.329	so I just work here a few minutes . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah the display , 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Uh don't you think ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	we yeah we can put a display . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.324	So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.325	The 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.326	The th 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Exactly . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Oh . This is hard . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.329	What do 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.330	don't have to draw it exactly do we ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	No it's it's uh it's okay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Wait . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Let me try it one more time . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Maybe I've uh it's easier if I draw it in once . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	You can make it m larger . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.335		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Maybe it's easier to to draw uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.337	This'll take forever . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.338	It's fun to work with this pen . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Um so , larger . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Oh . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Wrong one . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.340	And 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.341	yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.342	So side . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Five minutes left before the meeting ends . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.343	'Kay . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.344	Um other views ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.331		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Alright . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.345	Uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.346	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	That's the question . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	But we we 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.348	So this is gonna be from the 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	I is it if if this is from the side 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.351	uh from 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	woah . Steady . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	From the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.349	yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Sorry . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	Because there the screen goes up like that right ? 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	So then it's like this , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Yeah ? 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	it's better to have it somewhat like this . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	Or does it flip all the way ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah I'm I'm 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.354	The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Okay . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Because it do doesn't have to flip then . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.356	Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Because here 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.357	True . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	But why why do we need uh the flipping uh 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.358	you can adjust the angle to which it flips . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.359	So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.360	You can flip it up to there if you want . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	So w yeah . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	But we still keep the flipping mechanism . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Think so . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah we keep the flip ? 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Keep the flip live . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.363	I dunno . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350		
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Uh the the shape is okay but 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	yeah ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.364	I thought it would be cool . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	Yeah . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Because we 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Because we have enough space . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	H here we got uh the basic functions , 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Yeah there the middle 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	the the arrow uh yeah button . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354	Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	and then h we sh mm . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.355	And then like i oh th 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249		
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.365		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	doh . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Come on . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	So this is the shape . 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	Oh . It hasn't 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.366	. It doesn't aim so well . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Okay but the screen is a bit lower 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.361	because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah , then it's 	
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.362	So there's a layer of rubber on the side . 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.367	Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . 	
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.334		
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.363	So no flipping but just 	
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	No flipping or

TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.386	Yeah 	
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.387	or j or also scrolling for the m yeah .
