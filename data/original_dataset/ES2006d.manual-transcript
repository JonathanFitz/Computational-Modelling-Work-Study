ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	I'm proud of it . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	And again I'll take minutes . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	The 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Um then 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	It does look very cool . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	So we've got forty minutes . S 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	And then do we get to make a remote control ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	'Cause we missed out . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	So 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	it's now 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	so we've got until four fifteen . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Is that right ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	How how much do we have , forty minutes ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	until about four fifteen . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	So yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Okay , so . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Go for it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Do you want 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	So , you said um 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	are are we starting with the the 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Yes . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Presentation . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Okay . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Um 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	It's a bit um phallic . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Yeah . Um 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Dual use , perfect . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Dual use , perfect . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Oh , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	your remote control 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	? Oh that's just bad . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Sorry , sorry . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	So now we we have the okay , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	And we have the user interface o in here 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Wow . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Um 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	well , everything else is probably user interface , so . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Uh yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Rubber . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Yeah , . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um it could be made a bit smaller , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	and and of course it would be and 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	so we said the back side round , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	It l does look like the curvy 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	and then the whole shape's curvy , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Mm . Hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	And it's spongy as well . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Huh . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Six seven eight nine . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	I like that . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	And then , well this is on off button . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	It's it's quite standard mm place for it 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and and also the colour is quite often red , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	so it's it's kind of user friendly . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	like the previous one and the next one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	So where's the volume ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	The volume is is scrolling . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	On the side , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	It's on the side . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	this one . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Ah , you did get that in then , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Yeah you just do it like this . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Oh okay , . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	See ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	So the volume is you just scroll , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	You can move back and forth 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Cool . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Uh no , we we'd not put 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	A mute button . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Well , but the but the mute 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	But if you hold it in , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Okay , yeah , okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Okay , cool . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	So that that solves the whole mute issue . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Mm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	You can't really see it in the interface . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	no . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	And we do have the logo on it as well . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm-hmm , very good . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	So I think it 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	. 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	We ran out of resources here , so . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	In the actual one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	So if you have questions . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	You can have a look . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Very good , let's have a look . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Test it out . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	. 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	I hate Play-Do , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	it's just minging . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Very good . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	and then we'll there 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah , see the budget . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .

ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Okay , cool . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Okay ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Cool , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	so these are what they are . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Oh 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Is that right ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Yes , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Mm dots , never mind . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah , the yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	it's definitely attractive . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah , I agree . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah , just prepare one now . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Shall I just prepare it now ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	It will be red , too . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Cool . Okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	So , be attractive to look at . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	That's this one . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	What do you all say ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	I reckon it 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	I I go for seven . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Seven , yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Oh we're all so proud of the . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yes . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	it's terribly sexy . Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Could 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Ah , okay . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Excellent . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Except we can't 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	uh we can if we 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	But that's alright . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	But we can we can 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	If you take a note of them , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	I can I can take note uh uh 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	and then I'll put them in in a minute . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Cool , okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	I would think yes , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	I think it does . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	I mean 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Alright . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	But that's gonna be a problem , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	But then yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	So bu it's it's not a huge problem , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	because i i it is operatable . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	so they just 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	but they can normally do most things right-handed , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	so I would say it's not such a big issue . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Right . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Yep . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	maybe give it a five , I would say ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Um 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	What do you what do you all think ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Six . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Or maybe six , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Mm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	because it's just one one i one among the issues , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	I think I think for um 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	I mean . Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	I mean most people are right-handed , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	One more thing is that i 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Okay . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	They 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	so it opens on the side . So 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Yeah yeah yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	So it won't be a problem , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	I mean yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	So you guys can decide wh whether 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	it will be and it will be 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	it won't be heavy . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Oops . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah well yeah , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	but it's it's a bit long . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	The length is gonna be difficu 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	It's a little bit long . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah um 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Uh this this kind of uh makes it more 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Because 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	S uh slightly smaller . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	So you have to keep that side flat . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Right . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Okay . Um okay , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	so C_ . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Are are we admitting defeat on C_ 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	No , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	No , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	we're gonna put it like we've got 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	we have a locator . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	th there's the locator dot . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	There's a locator . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Cool , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Mm that you stick on T_V_ . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	doesn't it ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	To make it beep . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Yeah well w 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Or a buzzer . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	but l but the speak sample speaker is included , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Okay . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So that's two , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	so that's seven , yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	It's locatable ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Yep . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Fabulous . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	D_ . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Intuitive , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	completely intuitive . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	and it's I th I think it's 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	I'd say six , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	I really like the way you have it , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Intuitive . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Yeah , and I mean d 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	So 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Might be 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	so it is kind of not very intuitive 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	So , should we maybe say f a five 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	So l 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Five ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	and say it is intuitive , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	but it's different , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	but you might have to think about it first . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	So we give that one a five , you think ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	I'm happy with five ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Yep . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	I'm glad you're accepting this . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Um intuitive but 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Sorry , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	it's really hard to write on those . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Um okay , cool , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	E_ , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yep . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	But otherwise it's superb . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	So , should we give it a six ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Six . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Six ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	. 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah . Yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	yeah ? See . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	unless you are a all the time sitting . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Yeah , so it's kinda 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Well we've banned them from 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	it's varied . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yeah . Six ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Okay , so we give that a six , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Okay , F_ . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Yeah , it does have yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Absolutely . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Voice control have 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	seven . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Hang on , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	That's just 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Ah , that's the second one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	but not on the previous slide . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Oh okay , cool . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Um right , so . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	So it has voice control . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Yes , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	so that's a seven then . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yep . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Um , cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	G_ technologically innovative . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Anyway it ha yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Technologi well 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah , but I mean you don't 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	All of the components have been used in other things before . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	But do 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	. 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	What do you reckon , five , six ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	what do you all think ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Six . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Six ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Well , that's it , I mean 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	It still has to do what i what it has to do . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	So , I don't think many peop 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Space remote . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	That's it , they can take it with them . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Put fashion in electronics . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Absolutely . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	The carrot banana remote . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	It's the maximum fashion . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	So , we give it seven , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	and we write 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	There we go . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	So I think we've done very well , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	I think that's a . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	but 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Very good . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	What's the assessment ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	So , we need the average here , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	so we got 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	The average is about six and something . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Yeah , one . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	A little bit over six . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Seven 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Or a seven . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	There are how many sixes ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	No , wait , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	So we've got four sevens , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	One , two , three . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	a little bit under six . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	so that's twenty eight , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	No , wait . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Three . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	three sixes , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	And one five . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	eighteen . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Six point point 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Fifty one divided by 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Six point something , yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Two three four Seven eight . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	about six point five . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Six point five , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Close enough . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Okay , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	that's pretty good , I think . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	That's all you've got at the moment , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	or did you have anything more ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Um no , that's it , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172	That's it ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Alright . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	So , finance . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.175	And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Cool , there we go . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Sorry , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177	this is I'm just um 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	. 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	There we go and there are the marks . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Beautiful . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Not anymore . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Computer no signal ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Adjusting . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.182	There we go . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Okay , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.184	so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	And now we have to calculate the production costs . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Can you read that ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Almost . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.189	More or less . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Um I started filling it in , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.192	No hand dynamo , right ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.193	One simple battery . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.194	No kinetic energy , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.195	no solar . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.196	The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Advanced , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.201	We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yep . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Yeah , yes . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Case material we said rubber . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Rubber . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Yep . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.204	I don't know what special colour means . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Mm anything uh I think which is not more . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.205		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	I think something coloured , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	yeah , probably . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	So I think this is probably special co no ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.206	It could be 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Rub rubber comes coloured , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.208	it's I would 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.209	maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	yeah yeah , okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.211	let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.212	We we're definitely going to have to 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	We have pushbuttons , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.213	so we've got pushbutton , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.214	and then we've 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	scro we have scroll wheel as well . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	S yeah , yeah , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	No uh we we have uh yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155	we had , for muting , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	And we have L_C_ display 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	and yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.217	And button supplements . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Um 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Mm no . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	. 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	No . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	We don't have 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.218	No . No ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	we're not using any of that . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.219	But the the spinning wheel's not there . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.220	I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Okay , let's yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	We've got more than one pushbutton though , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.221		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	haven't we ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.222	I think the pushbutton 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.223	oh . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	'Cause then you have 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.224	I don't know if that's one 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.226	That seems unlikely . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Push what uh 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Huh ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Twelve point five . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.228	whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	We have to count all of them , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163	or yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Mm I don't think so , no . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.229	I don't think that makes sense . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	No . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Well it doesn't , but it uh 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	No it says what what is the kind of interface , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.230	No . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	And L_C_ display . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.235	So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Wh wh what's our criteria ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	This sample sensor . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Our budget's twelve point five . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Uh okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.238	so that has implications though for the . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Uh it does not have for voice recognition , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	but it does have for the feedback speaker . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.239	For the locator . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Mm and the locator also goes away . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	We can afford to get rid of it . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	But it was very no innovative 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.241	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	So that means no locator , does it ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	innovativeness . Well um yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	I mean does 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.242	What else does it need ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.244	'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	This would be 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah , yeah yeah 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	there you record your samples your speech samples and 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.245	Yeah , okay , so we 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Uh I mean uh um yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Right , so we need one fifty off . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Um 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	'cause 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Take it down to just a scroll wheel . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.249	We could do 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	So tha that mean that we cannot press 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	If 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Yeah b 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	no no , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	you can push this one , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	But that's well you would just have to to spin it down . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.251	You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	So that's point three . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	No w w w but ha 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	it's it's the scroll wheel 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178	If you 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.220	I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.221	That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Didn't that come with the L_C_ 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.252	That's with the L_C_ 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	That comes with the L_C_D_ ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.253	We decided , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.254	'cause it's not on our list . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Oh so so the the this is 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.255	The scroll wheel is on the side . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	. So 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	we're adding costs for right , okay 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	uh I mean I think this is good . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	So 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.225	S so we're point three over . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.256	We're point three over at the moment . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.257	It's nothing n 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.227	and just have pushbuttons for the volume . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Could b still put them on the side . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.229	But yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.258	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.230	I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.259	I have 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	On the side . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.260	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Okay , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Rather than having three different things that people have to do . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	. 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.262	There we go . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Oh look , we're way under budget 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.264	and we'll make huge profits 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.265	and we'll all get bonuses . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Yeah , but 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.267	So that's alright . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.268	We we'll leave it at that 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.269	and then I'll take I can send it back to management 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.270	and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.271	if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	We have , yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.272	yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.273	Excellent . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Alright . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.275	So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.237	No . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.238	No , I don't think so . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Not really , no . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Because we keep all the features , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	we keep voice recognition , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	we keep L_C_D_ display . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.276	Mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.239	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	We 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.277	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.240	We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.278	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Um yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.241	and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.242	it's not a great difference I don't think . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.280	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.281	Alright then . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	But we lose the locator . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Well we're going to have a beeping thing . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Really ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.282	We're gonna have a beep . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	So instead of speaker , . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.283	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	so we still have the locate . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.284	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	'Kay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Cool . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.245	That's not a very exciting colour . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.246	I think you should make it more vegetable-like . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.285	Tha 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Which colour , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	the the colour of the phone or the colour of the 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Oh the the beeper thing . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.279	. 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	But it can be yellow as well . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.248	It 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	It can come in the same colour as the the case . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.286	'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.192		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.287	Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.251	You know , your pen vibrates ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.252	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.288	But only for a very short time . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Um 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.290	okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.291	So 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.292	looks like we've designed a banana . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.249		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.193		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.293	Well done , team . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Um we need 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.295	we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.296	so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.297	um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	I think it mm 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.253	Cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.298	Feedback ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.299	Ideas ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Yeah mm , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.195	as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.196	The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.300	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194		
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.301	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.302	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	So , had we known 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.255	If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Yeah , that or not , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.303	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.256	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.304	But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Yeah , mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.257	I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.305	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.258	It wasn't like we were alone for very long , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.259	so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.306	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.198		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.307	Banana . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.260	and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.308		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Um yeah , so yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.309	Mm-hmm , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.310	the whiteboard digital pens . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.201	And the pens . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Uh I like the pens . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.311	We like the pens . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.263	I want one . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.264	That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.312	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.313	you could take it to lectures 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.314	and just write stuff down 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah yeah yeah , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.315	and have it printed out when you got back to the office . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	that's it's it's 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.316	They great ? 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	I wonder what one of these costs . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.317	Do you think they'd notice if one went ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.203		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.265	I don't think you should say that was the recording . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.318	Oh okay . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Okay , cover up the microphone . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.267	Alright , let's take it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.319	Yep . Shh . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.204		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.320	Yep . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.268	Okay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.321	But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.322	'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.323	and you can't change it once you're in there , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.269	It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.270	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.324	yep . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.272	The thing flew in , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.325	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.273	you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.274	'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.326	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.327	That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.275	Not that you can do that on the board , either . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.276	We could make some little 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.208	But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.277	Yeah , totally , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.278	I mean that was fairly tight anyway , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.328	Mm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.279	I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.329	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Mm yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.281	back it , this is just had to be changed 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.210		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.280	. And yeah , so cool . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.330	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.282	Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.331	And presumably you don't 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.332	you can say nasty things as well . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.283		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.212	I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.334	I have no stake in it . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.284	Yeah , definitely . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.285	You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.335	You have to say that , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.336	'cause I'm taking the notes . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.337	I'll leave the room and you can have another go . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.286	I know you've got the pen , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.287	you might attack me with it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.338	Better than that than the banana . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.214	And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.339	I think it worked quite well . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.288	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.340	Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.215	To express them mm mm 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.216	no . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.341	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.289	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.333	. 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.342	New ideas found . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.343	Not quite sure what about . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Well it's it's it's pretty new , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.345	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.218	pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.346	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.290	I don't know , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.291	I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Yeah , neither neither do I , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.292	maybe somebody's already though of it . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.220	but I've never seen anything 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.347		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.221	and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.348	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.293	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.295	I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.349	Yeah , that's right . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.296	That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.350		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.351		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.298	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Patent patent patent . Mm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.352	Banana remote . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.299	I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.300	but we've got no way of finding out . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.353	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.354	Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.222		
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.301	That vibrates 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.356	Flip . Vibrate 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.302	Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.355	. And uh yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.357	Nothing that you really want . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223		
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.223		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.358	True . Yeah . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.297		
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.359	Okay . So , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.360	costs are within budget , 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Yes . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.303	Yes . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.361	well within budget , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.362	including a little what have we got ? 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.363	One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.364	Um we've evaluated the project . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Yes . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.365	You've got the scores . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.304	And it's fabulous . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.366	Can you put that in the project documents file ? 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.305	It's in the project documents . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.367	It's in there already . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.368	And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.369	Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.370	or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.229	And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.371	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Otherwise it's it's all fine .

ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.307	sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	I thought that was good though , 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute .

ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.310	Yeah , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.311	we've got like five minutes left . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.375	We've got about five minutes left , 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.376	but if we've finished , then we've finished . 	
ES2006d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Yeah . 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.377	We're just too too efficient 	
ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.378	and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . 	
ES2006d.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	We certainly are , 	
ES2006d.B.dialog-act.s9553330.312	Yeah .

ES2006d.C.dialog-act.s9553330.387	I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
