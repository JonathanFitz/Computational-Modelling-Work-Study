TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	. 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	So it doesn't draw the attention away . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	This is dreadful . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I made uh uh my own map . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	No not this , but the task . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Oh yeah sure . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	It's a

TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Ah . Uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	where was it ? In settings ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . Alright . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Thank you . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Huh . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Do you guys like your tasks ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah wa wa you actually 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So frustrating . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yeah exactly . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Really annoying . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . So there we are again . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	By your humble P_M_ . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay this is the agenda . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um we have three presentations , I heard . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Really . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah really . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	So who wants to start ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah that's fine . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	We have to start it right away ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Functional ? Yeah functional requirements . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Uh this is you ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	'Kay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Users think they're ugly . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	they are often lost somewhere in the room . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	And they're bad for R_S_I_ . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Um 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Ts 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Um but they are used . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I mean the 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So they do need to be in the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So um yeah we have to . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	often . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	We c we c 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah I mean w we can't 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Next generation does . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	my my T_V_ has , 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	No . Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	but we we can leave them uh away . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	uh they speak for themselves I guess . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh teletext 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	N not used anymore . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So forget this one . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah . I was wondering uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I didn't get anything . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah , on on the project uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Not by mail . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	I receiv the mail but you don't . So 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	No so it's a text file n in the project folder . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	But you you've got more information than uh . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So teletext can be skipped . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	That's in the presentation , so 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So it's above forty I guess . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Uh below I believe . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	The new product ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Or below 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah below forty . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	because that's pretty relevant . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I thought I read a 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Below ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Okay well 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	But where did you get uh that information ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	that's that's in the newsfla 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	That's in a newsflash . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	okay that's a good to know . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So I think we can build that in . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Um and and also there's 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	But it also needs to have corporate identity . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	so the the logo has to be 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	uh present yeah , and the colours as well . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Present and the colours . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So we can't change much of that . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Do we have 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	uh yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yes . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	'Kay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	It's open already so you can use to 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	. 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	find yours . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It's 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	F_ five .

TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Oh no . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	How do I uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	You pressed alt F_ four ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	No no no . I pressed the mouse button . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Oh great . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	It's th 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	that's the self-destruct button . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah . Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um if you all go stand around uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Just 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Computer 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Sure . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Alright . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	That's nice . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	No . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	F_ five . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Alright . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	I uh had uh two examples . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	This the easy one 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	The mm yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	So we 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Okay so so we have the option for more functions . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	So not not too much but yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Um yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	And the speech recognition yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	alright . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	But 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Mm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Okay one device . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . So n it's very easy . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . I didn't see . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So w 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Now yeah it's okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So there are not extra options in this case , but uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Uh yeah the basic functions . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	so maybe you can hide them or something . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah you make a screen menu or something . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	And the and the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	and then the basic function just on the device itself . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	What does the screen do ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Did I uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Uh . What are wh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Alright . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . It's low power . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	did I break it ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	What . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	So what does the screen do ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	They said they needed it but what does it do ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	What do they want with the screen ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	For for the advanced functions I think . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah that's what we make it up . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah well it yeah it didn't 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	So but what did the marketing 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	No . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah okay it's handy . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	With no predefined uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Like searching for channels and 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah searching for channels , programming them . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Ah look . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	We have your uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	oh never mind . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	We're back online . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	That's uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I'm al I'm almost finished so 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Um the 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm-hmm . Content and form . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	yeah content and form . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	. 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Now that that was uh was the end . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	That was the end . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yes . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Well you can improvise right ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah a little bit . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Uh no . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	This one ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	No no . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Functional requirements ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah I think that would be it then . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	No . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	So we we can go for 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I have no idea . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	You didn't put it in ? Or 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	That w . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	it's not really English . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Let me check . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I know . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Uh kick off . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Oh working design I got it . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Here you go . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Alright how do I uh skip pages ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Just uh press uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	The keys yeah ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Alright . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	And well the info on the website which came too late . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Those were my uh starting points . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Mm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	And then make the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Design ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	the design , a the actual design , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Design yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	but I never came around to do that . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah frequency . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah decoder . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Um 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah well this was actually all I got around to do . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Blank . Yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Work harder . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . Whatever . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	'Kay . Um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Mm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	We have to make be clear what that is . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	group of users , or 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah users . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	because it says below forty I mean . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah so I think it's easy but 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	But uh it's it's also for children or just uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Uh six 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	So below forty is okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	But we need an lower level which to s uh focus . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	How do you mean ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Uh sixteen to forty . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah ? 'Kay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	We we have to 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Design . Mm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	And maybe y 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Experienced yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Na 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Uh you can make a if you make a drawing . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . Aye yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Uh . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Shall I uh 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Uh black's okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	And draw it very big . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Oh . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . It's okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	no , it doesn't have line control , so 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah we get the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah well , this is basically uh it's 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	The remote ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	alright the remote ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	The remote , yeah ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Basic . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Is on top . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	so it should fit right in into your hand . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	L left top or right uh top ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Right . Right . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	T I s should said right . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Right top . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah , right . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	I most people are right-handed so 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah definitely . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	If you put it like like here . Or something . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	I dunno . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Do the also with the thumb . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	You you need to be able to hold it so 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Okay for example if you put the screen here , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah okay that's true . Layout . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	That's for the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Doesn't work too well . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	It's uh it's bent . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	I can't help it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	. 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	You broke it . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	. 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Right . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Man . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay you get it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Uh for example if y if you put all the 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Right . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	And might be easier huh ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Maybe this . kind of works . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	um and here one for for 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Uh . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	And the for flipping up and down . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And volume control . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah I 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	And left to right . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	And those can also be used for the menu . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah exactly . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	And you you have 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	And 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	For the menu . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	and then just 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	So you scroll into it , okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	You select a function like v like uh bass . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	You just adjust it with these two buttons . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Then okay to confirm , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	And then finally say okay , exit . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Or or one button to exit it . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	That's more your uh your department to to uh to 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	On the left uh top yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	I mean it's uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	But it's essential that there is a screen . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	But um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Yeah 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	so it should be 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	This would be uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	I mean i 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	No that's not s sure so 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	That's not sure 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	but it's 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	uh we need a display . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah may maybe because you're 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Normal for logical t 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah they're used to it . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Okay the yeah . That's possible . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	I mean if you grab it . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay we put it on top . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	like over here . R_R_ . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Maybe on the top or even on the side . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	True . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	I think that top is the best option . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I dunno . Should be able to work . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah . . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Never mind . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Can we leave this up to you ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Yeah it doesn't matter that much . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	So 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	but um the screen is on top ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Which functions did we have left ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Volume . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Up . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Screen is over there . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	If we 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yeah . That's uh that's a good one . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Like uh bass uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	so sounds ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Sound ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	so we need kind of an equaliser . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	If you 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah . Equaliser . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	So if you have sound 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	But not too advanced . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah it it's just a remote control so 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	and they're 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	They're not used often so 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	It's uh pretty hard to write . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Ah as 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Mm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah just 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	. 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Okay but you have sound ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah sounds . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah just 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	oh y you have digital uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	. 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	better write it down over there yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Of course . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	So you have sound . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I'm just a secretary . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Coffee ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yes please . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Treble bass . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	the mono stereo option ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Yeah . Also . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	And there there was something else also . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	And then pitch . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Pitch I believe , yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Pitch . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	But pitch , isn't that 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	yeah that's the the height of the tone . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Yeah okay , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah and mono stereo . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	wh why would you use that ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	If people like talk like uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Mm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	And also the tuning part ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Programming part . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah programming . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Uh so we have sound , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	So channel programming ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	yeah ? Channel programming . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	And yeah in the functionality of the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Television uh itself uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	no no of the remote 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Mm . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I dunno . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Mm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	I think it g it gets annoying . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	But uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Contrast yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Mm . No . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Uh , so contrast , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	y yeah contrast and brightness ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	bright , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	uh 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	And the others were in your presentation right ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	So I can just copy those ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Well yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Okay . It's easy . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	I will look it up . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	The sound , sound and image . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Indeed . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309		
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	So we need two menus kind of thing . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Uh-huh . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Yeah with the chip and then I mean 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	So you 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Uh yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	You have an additional processor and and software part . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Well yeah we have power button , whether that's present . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Alright . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Compared to o 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Channel volume selection present . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Uh numbers present . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	L_ s 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Colour . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Yeah I I call it contrast . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Yeah con contrast is 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Yeah I make it c colour . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Yeah okay , colour and brightness . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Yeah and automatically um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Yeah , autoseek . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Uh name a channel , or 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Oh they get automatic names , okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	So you only have to choose the position on your 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	. 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Help . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	If you already programmed it . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	How do you call that ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Yeah how do you call that ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Mm ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Channels ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Ninety nine or something . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	S swap channels ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Can I call it that ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Yeah . Swap channels . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Swap's good option . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Uh other functions ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	So you 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	most of the time if you if you swap it 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	It's it's pretty uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	working design . Doch . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	on the T_V_ . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Also . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.292	That's you're 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	He only has to figure out how it has to look . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	And how 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	to use 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	But 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	You did your homework . But um yeah . Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295		
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	No no . It should be able to do any remote . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	No I don't think so . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	No that's 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	Uh . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	But I think the communication with the television is difficult . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	But that's not our part . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	No . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	We don't have to design a protocol so 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	No . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	That's true . That's true . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300		
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Thank god . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Okay 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350	So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	No that's the 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354	It's easier , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.355	it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	So we have to think of something for that . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	So but 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Yeah k kind of structure into layers . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	I put them on the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	On the uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	yeah can you i make a a map with with all the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	. 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Yeah . Yeah I can . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	and 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	I'll just try to reorganise uh things . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	So 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Um 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Uh um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	And and the layout of of the thing itself . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	I think 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	th I think the yeah the layout of the screen 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	The the layout of the remote control ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	. 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	. 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	No I d I think that's more in 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	. 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Maybe more on 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	I have to know what it has to do , 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Okay . So he's layout and you're function . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Form function okay . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	I think that's a that's a good separation . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Mm . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Are you going to do that ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Yeah . Yeah I guess so . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah ? I I'm going to make 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.323	I think i that's your department yes , 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	yeah o okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.364	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.324	because w he already knows what 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah we have to kind of work together . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.325	But we're not allowed . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.365		
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159		
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Okay . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.366	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	I think yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.367	With with some l with some layers in it . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.368	So some menus . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.369	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.330	because that's always the difficulty . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Every device has its own 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.370	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.371	Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Menu okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.372	menu okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.373	Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.374	Uh like uh for your mobile phone . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.375	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.376	so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Mm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.377	And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Back . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.378	So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.379	Or the or the no button . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.380	To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	W we 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.381	but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	and 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Yeah but they're incorporated ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah okay 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.382	Yeah because this this is used for both . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	but we we have a m 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Up and down is 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	yeah but maybe that's that's not uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Smart ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.383	Into your screen . Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.384	So you 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.385	l should leave the menu button out of here . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	You wanna separate uh 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.386	And and just put it under the screen , the screen 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Put it on top . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah j just just group group the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.340	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.387	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	So we make a yeah a line between them . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.388	But we should place the screen on top , right ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Well 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.344	But that's uh J Jurgen's department . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.395	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.396	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	So we make it a 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.397	You just you just find out and . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.345	You just make the layout . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.346	You 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.347	do we do the extra two buttons or not ? 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	I think you should . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	It's easier . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.349	Yeah okay . That's true . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.398	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	So we have a a menu button and a s 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.350	And to , okay and back , also . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.399	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay . Okay and back button . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.400	Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.351	And of course the four arrows . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.401	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	No . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.352	But those are still y doubly used . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.402	Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Both the L_C_D_ 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	We have a menu button and 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.354	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.403	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.404	That that just to to activate the screen . So 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	That's the the one with the 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	yeah okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.405	And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.356	You can navigate . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.357	But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Okay 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.358	Those are both both 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	multifunctional . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.359	yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.406	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.407	L l litten up yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.408	That's very good idea . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Oh five minutes . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	N 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.409	Alright . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.410	Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Light uh 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Yeah sure . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Okay . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.411	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.364	Um 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.412	So 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.366	Anything else ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.413	Those buttons are are lit up . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	I think not . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.414	But just one thing . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.415	Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.416	And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.365	I've 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.417	Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.367	Volume . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.418	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.419	And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Well we have those buttons . We use all four . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	No 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	sorry 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.369	Yeah okay go ahead . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.420	Yeah ? 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.421	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.422	And one back . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.370	Yeah that was already decided . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.371	Okay that's what we decided earlier on . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah okay . Yeah . 	
TS3006b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.423	Yeah . 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.372	Right okay . So 	
TS3006b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	You wanna close down huh ? 	
TS3006b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.373	yeah I wanna close down . 	
TS3006b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204
