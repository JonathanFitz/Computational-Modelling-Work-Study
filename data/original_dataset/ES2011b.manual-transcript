ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Welcome everybody . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um hope your sessions went well . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Um so this is our functional design meeting , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	um they're not finished yet . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Right . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	And I can start if you want . Mm . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	sure . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Is there an order ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	No . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	We haven't decided on an order . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Hm ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	No , any any order's fine . Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	First . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um , how do I put this 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Just uh 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	I'll just put the cable in . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Oh yeah , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	sorry . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Is that it ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Can you see ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Oh , here . Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	So what happens it doesn't work ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	It sh it takes a few seconds I think . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	You may need to 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Who's that ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	No . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Is it in the right thing ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	But sometimes you have to do it 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Oh wait , um . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh . You need to help me . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Uh-huh , and then press function . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	and F_ eight . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Could you just plug it back into hers 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	because she had 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Oh , wait . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	That's 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	oh . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	is that it ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Adjusting . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Here we are . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	The cable might be a little loose or something . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Right here we are . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh , you got it . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Oh . Is it on ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	We're here . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay , um . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	through just their habits to n know 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	they don't like the way they feel , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	they don't think they match their operating behaviour , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	and I think we should design according to these buttons . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	I don't know what R_S_I_ means . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Hm . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	And um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	so this is the order . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	and then , just one , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	I don't really know how to describe this , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	but we should discuss this together . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	And that's all I have to say about the matter , um . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	'Kay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Shall I 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	what do I do ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Do I give this to someone else ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah . Just move right on . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Right . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	So get this . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Uh function F_ eight . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Function F_ eight . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	'Kay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	What's function ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	It's the little blue w it's the one th 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh function , I see it . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	There we go . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah should be 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	It should be yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . Um . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	This my presentation about the uh technical functions design 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um so I think things like uh 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	uh 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I'm not sure we c 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Um does it do 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And then , is it findable , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	and uh how do we wanna do that ? 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	And um 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	um I dunno if this will work but 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	That concludes my presentation . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Okay . You need the little thingy . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Ooh . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	How do I um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	S 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	That's on view . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Oh . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Right . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	um input which would probably be buttons , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	although um we just talked about voice recognition , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	processor to take the information , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And also you need a sender for location signal , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	um a button pad for input , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So that concludes my presentation . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	'Kay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Do you know about like 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	I dunno , you seem like you know about 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Mm ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Okay . Cool . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Well thank you everybody . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Um we have 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	we'll discuss that 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46		
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	also our remote should be used only for television , um , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	so let's be fashionable I guess . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Um if we have something 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Okay . Um . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um , yeah . Do Let's 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I guess we should yeah make some 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	kind of brainstorming , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Like in terms of 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	see what we can 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	How it looks or 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	how it looks , or like what it does ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	wha what um 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	and I dunno the the s 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Is our target group then people 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	I think that seems to yeah . Mm . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	It's easy to implement . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So the 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	the the buzzer you mean , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	yeah , for sure , yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Locator . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	what was it ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Well that's for speech recognition . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Oh . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Well 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Oh , uh . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	And screen . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	That's only for speech recognition and screen . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	I was thinking about that 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	or 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Mm . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	it seems like a silly , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I mean 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I'm not sure how you would implement it . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	I just put the values in . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	And if if you consider our budget , it probably 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	But um the screen is the same as what , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It's a cool idea but 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah , I'm happy with that . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Completely . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Hu yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Right so um yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Alright . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	right . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	so if you need to find the remote , click the button . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So it's now like a two-part thing . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah , so it would be a two part package . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay . Alright . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So we get to design that too . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Make it fashionable . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um , okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah I think so . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . Just there . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Huh . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	you talking about a home for it . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	or shall we leave that for now ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	We probably leave that . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	I mean I guess one takes care of the other , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Then it can live anywhere . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	For the 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	so you have that button , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	that so there's 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Are we just having a radio ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	On the phone . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	T 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	You don't need a light . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I think that's what the phone has , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	You can hear it's under the couch yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So i Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	So need the other buttons . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	So we have this mm . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I don't remember who showed them , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	That was that was me . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	yeah you you did um , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	they're 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Oh really . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	And uh 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	They're not no . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	They're not , no . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	S 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah , that's right , yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	It not V_H_S_ here ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	But D_V_D_ probably is . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But V_C_R_s 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah . Yeah , for sure . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So . Okay , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	let's see if I can 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Well for sure we need the um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I think we can just design the channels ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	S 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Huh . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	s and it's usually that red 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	You know , I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Oh okay , yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	It seems like that would be hard though . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	But 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I mean , like because unless you know 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	It might be confusing . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Just 'cause I wouldn't 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Besides you like to be able to go power . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah , I never think to hold something down . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	I have the power 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	B Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I guess . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	So we definitely want a power button and numbers . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Right . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well even um iPod thing , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	like um , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I don't know if people like this 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	scrolling 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	I don't know . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Mm . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Because people li seem 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Know you don't have one two three four five 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Mm . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	it's it's funny like you f like I just 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	and you just sort of and 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	like it's not that hard , you know . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah yeah , it's just and it's one thing which has everything . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah , and it is yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	It is really 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Well can't it tell the like can't you if you 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Oh that's gonna 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Like a disc . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . Yeah . It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	I've never used one . No . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	It's like l this like that , and then you do that . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yeah and then . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	And then you can have um 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So like it's like a little part of the circle that 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Or it 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	you can 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Well i 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , click o actually click on to have 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	zap . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	We could we could even have four buttons , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	So volume could be like the top it and the bottom 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So do you need to 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Doesn't it rotate though , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	okay . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	so it'll be moving around . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	What do you mean the function ? 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	I mean like okay , 'cause so 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	I dunno , I guess Okay 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	That that means you're gonna go up the channels , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	But then 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah but it knows for some reason . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	It just 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	The iPod knows . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	It just kno the iPod knows . S 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	If it works on an iPod then it works . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144		
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Huh . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I don't have one . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Oh . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	And then well if you do that it goes , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	So it's like holding 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	but if you like that makes more sense 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	You can o 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	And you 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	you 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	is there an extra actual button ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Well what you 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Like 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	for the iPod you press an 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	It's like a b 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Right . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Like you could just have 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	I don't know , 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	you could click and then have it up and down , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Oh , like 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Like 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Oh you could actually 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	but I think 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	like , it has to be 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	is that part of 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Is that what makes them expensi 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	yeah , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I don't think so . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I think it's all of 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	I dunno , I dunno . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	they have so much memory though , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	You don't think so ? 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	that's it's 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I don't think it's the wheel dealy . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I think it 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Okay . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	. 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	I'm thinking we could 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	if if we're hav So ba 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And they're re-programmable aren't they ? 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	S 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	and that's another thing they complained about . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Mm . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um , what other buttons were there ? 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Volume 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	oh we've ts just said that . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	So okay . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Channel selection . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	This is just for T_V_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	I 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Um 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So how do you switch 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Menu . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	and menu maybe . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Oh yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Okay . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	So like if we had that 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	But we'll hold off on that 'cause 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	But s yeah uh . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	That's true , yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	So , I know I'm not c really clear on what 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	But it's cool to have it all on one , 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Mm . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So you'd have to have like 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	I think you would have to have like a function switch button , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah , it is only fun 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	But i 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Oh . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But I think the circle only does 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah but it it would be 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	So but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	so like you're if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	or s you know , to different 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	I mean do we need to think about that , 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	that like 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um , yeah , let's think about it 	
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Yes we can try that . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	'cause we need to wrap up . 	
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Okay . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Um let's see . 	
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187		
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . 	
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	See you soon .
