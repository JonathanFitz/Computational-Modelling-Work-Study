TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Again , I'm gonna take minutes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	You two guys ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . Go ahead . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	. 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	coffee . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	'Kay , we've made a prototype . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Um , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	we've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	we've uh drawn here the p prototype . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	but 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Maybe you can uh point them uh The functions . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Uh , it's a little bit . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Uh , power button . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Uh then the the the nine uh channels . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I thought that was th 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Alright , I 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Oh , the mute button . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Do y do you 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	did we want to have a m mute button ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	But uh that 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	It's uh here then , in the middle . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Huh . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yes , um 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	we've disc 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Well , yeah mo uh mo 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the on 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Most of the users 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah , and a and a triangle on that . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	uh d I call it teens and twenties . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh , y th th th the two numbers . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	All n no , that's um kinda dependent on the television . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah , true , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It's a television . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	but do we have do we need extra buttons , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	for example some uh some have to 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I think 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Uh I think so . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	uh th with the one and a double uh uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	I think you should add 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Zero ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	May maybe here ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	And then a second . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	No , that's dependent on the television . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	No , I don't think so . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I do know so . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Is it depending on television ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Nah , I don't think so really , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	because you have a 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yes , but but a lot uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Or actually , the other way around . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	But 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	No , I think uh I really think it's n 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	because you can 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yes , but 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah , well but su If 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	some televisions don't accept uh that that 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	No , no , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	but s 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	No no no . So some television respond differently . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Look , if uh i i 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	No , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	listen listen . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yes , that's true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	The one with dash , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	that signal gi 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	True . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	No 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	I think it works that way , really . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	No , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yep . True . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	I think it's exact the same thing when y 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	You want 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yes , but some television don't support it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	But the ex 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Listen , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	with that that's 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	that special but button you're talking about , eh ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Do y you 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	No , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	a remote can 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yes , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	so they need no , they need 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	But you give the input . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	You push the one . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	That's the same thing as the button with the one and it 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	No , that's not true . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	It's simply not true . It's simply not true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	yes it it is . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Think about it . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	No , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	but uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	And it's the same thing what happens 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Remote control is a stupid thing . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah , but I m uh but it's 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah , it 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	But okay , we we'll impl 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	No , definitely not . Definitely not . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	We'll discuss them in the usability lab . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	No , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	we'll apply them then for now . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Uh eva evaluation . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Ach . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah but 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I don't know . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	No , no . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Uh , some 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Th won't work wi with uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	to have that special button . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	When you uh press one button , you give one signal . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	But 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yep . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Okay , well we'll see . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I kinda miss the docking station . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yes . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	It's here on the 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Well it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	yeah , uh there's nothing 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	We came uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	I think it's pretty basic , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	the the there's no fu 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	there's one there's one button , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	No nothing really trendy about it . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	that's wha there's there's 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	The button . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yep . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	uh hearing devices . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Yeah , of course . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yes , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	but we can make 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah , that's true , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	but uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Yes , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	but uh I I g 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Just have to be big enough for the biggest 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	That's a bit uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	yeah , I think 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	But then it's a little bit 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	No , but if if 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	like this , I'll I'll point it out , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	if you got uh a a a base a base like this , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	But it's just an idea . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I won't draw it really . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	If you got a base which is uh as big as this 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	But it's flat it's flat as as this , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	so we can p make all the products as flat as this . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	You can . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah sure , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	But i i i it's backwards . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	But it's it's backwards . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	oh , right , help . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	That's text . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	But 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yes , little holer littler Uh , little products go deeper in it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , sure , you're right . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yes . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	And uh uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Oh . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	But we have to look n I don't know . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I don't like the colours . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	which is the most common used uh function , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So it's it's it's really good design . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . Alright . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	That's it ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	The light . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	And other lights ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	No , o on the on the front . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Maybe the uh the logo . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	lights ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	But , it will also uh uh use batteries , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah , why not ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	and do we want to 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Of course . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Mm . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Yeah , what was uh on the 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Okay , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	but in the 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	oh yeah , the colour , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	isn't it ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Uh , in the same colour as the side . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah , I think I think that'll be good . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yes . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	so it will uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	'Cause I also don yeah , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yep . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	it's depends on the costs and such . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	but may I dunno if that's important , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	but we'll talk about that later . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay , for now this is this is okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	We will . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um , the next p y 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	you gonna give a presentation too ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Uh , I have to see the agenda . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Detail design . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	because the leftmost 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Evaluation criteria . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yep , that's me . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Alright . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	I will be needing that image , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	so leave it please . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Um 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Go away . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	I wanna have a colour over here , come on . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Right , the remote is not ugly , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	a bit weird sentence , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	but 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Uh , what would you say , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	because it's 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Uh , I mean it's kind of , our design . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	It's 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Background colour . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I don't know or uh I don't know how you 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	How do you guys feel ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Casting . Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	The different designs . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	yes , you can make it in your own uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	more to your own personality or or house style . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	No , not not fronts , but different designs . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Okay , but 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	What ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Or forty . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Personally . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	We can make it a one . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yes , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	but what is it ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	I think two or three . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Guido ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I agree . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Two or three . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I was 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	I was thinking about three , so I guess 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	three is uh a bit uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Okay , three . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	oh , what am I doing ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I'll mark it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah well , let that let's make that a one . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	One . One . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Antek , you agree ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah . You're not Antek . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	That's one thing for sure . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	I'm the I'm the usability , so 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I totally agree . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah , two or a one , I guess . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	The 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	It's something we really put work into . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah , I yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	It's all about the buttons . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	And our oh yeah , it's a b yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah ? Alright . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	That's a one ? You agree ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	I think we totally succeeded there . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	But 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Well 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Oh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah , well menu Yeah , maybe . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah , that's true . That's true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	And telete 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , we don't know if the uh they're necessary . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	the the 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	o they're used uh uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	yeah , m well , you d you've got a point . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I think a two . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Can 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	yes , three , two . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Came a long way , but not we didn't not uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Two or three ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Mm two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Two ? Antek . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	But you can't make a remote control without them , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Because we got 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	because 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	So 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	we put it on a two ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	The remote control has got a really trendy look . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yes . A one . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Maarten . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Yeah , uh a t I think a two . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Well . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	We 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Ever , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Guido . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	But I do think it's more 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Uh , I will I will make it a three , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	because uh yeah . I I th 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . True , yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	A th a three . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	oh , yeah , that's true . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	You agree on the two ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I i uh when you compare to the 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Great . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh uh what's the difference with 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Uh , I copied that one . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Well , uh forget that . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Um 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Go away . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	No . We're not 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	No , not L_C_D_ , so . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	well , maybe the the the on the side . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah , but we uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	you mean the rubber stuff ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , and the light . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	And the light maybe . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	But that that's not innovative . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	But 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Well , I g 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Lights lights are 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	it's more 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	It's not 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	seven ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	No , six . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Well , six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Or seven maybe , yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	No , six . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Or six . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Why uh why not a seven ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah , mine is seven . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	but it but it 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	How ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	With the lights it it's it's kind of future 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	m but 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Innovative in generally or just f original for 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	I'll 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	N no no , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah , it it's I think I think with its 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	t . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	A docking station is innova 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I think the the docking station , it's gonna be a kind of a problem . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	It's a part of the remote . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	I think more m 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	But 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Uh that that's n 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Well I i yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	No ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	It's it's a six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	six maybe , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	because 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	But the retrieval or the 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	That m f 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah , for the retrieval function . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yes , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Yeah , v 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	how would you innovate a remote control more ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	To put it on your head . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	no no , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	you know what I mean . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	You have 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah sure , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	but 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , it's 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	that's that's 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	think about it la later on 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	but 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	and uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Remote control is easy to use . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah , a two . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	I think a two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah , it's good . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	More two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Come on . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	The remote control hasn't got uh . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	No , I would have seen that one before . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Oh , you skipped one uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	I've just filled uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Uh , here . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Go away . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	You like the buttons . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Remote control will be bought by 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	It will be bought by people under the age of forty . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah . Definitely . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yes . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	In in 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Well 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Uh , just in general . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah , a two . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	We don't know . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah , but I think I think two . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	But 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , what do you think ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Antek ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	No , that's no comparison . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah , you can 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	yeah , you can be very picky about it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	And I don't mean two people . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	This is just guessing . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Make it a two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	W w 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	mu 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Right , the rem 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Oh no . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . Yeah , you have make an 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	We don't have the slogan though . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	slogan is quite obvious . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Oh , the slogan . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Can we see the slogan ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	The logo . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	A logo . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Underneath it or something . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yes , uh encrypted uh with 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Are we gonna do that ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	A three . Three . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Maybe a three this time . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yeah , a three . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Three ? I agree . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Because of the slogan 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	And uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Uh , it's a one or a two . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , two . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Two ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , make it a two . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Two . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Two . Alright . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Twenty six . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	It's a two point six . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	It's not that bad . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Alright , we 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah , and that's mostly the inno 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . True . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	which is uh quite a great score . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	This was my evaluation . So 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	We did a pretty nice job until now . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Um , is this your 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Whatever . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Okay . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Still opened or uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Okay , finance . Because um 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Shoot . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	I received uh a spreadsheet . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	A five . A five . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Oh . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Doesn't matter . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	because I didn't really fin uh I have a . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Didn't really finish it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Well , we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	We probably will . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I probably have already opened it here . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	try it again . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	But let's let's st start with beginning . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	We include one battery . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	I i uh I'll explain 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	its Uh , the 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	the components are listed over here . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Uh , price is given . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	We um yeah , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	The amount , yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	And then uh , we'll uh calcula 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Don't watch the number yet . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	I don't know if it's filled in properly . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Okay , we need one battery . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	One battery . I think one battery is enough . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	A s okay , this this is a p first problem . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Uh , I think 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	we should know how many simple chips , regular chips 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	But 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	The simple chip is e enough I I think , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	I don't know 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Where did we find this information ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Was it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	No , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	uh I 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Yes , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	my my my uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	And how do you know ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Maybe you can uh look it up right now . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Okay , but okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Then it's a simple chip . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	then it would be a simple chip . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yes , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Alright , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	I I I s I 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	That will be enough for future uh recommendations . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	The sample sensor sample speaker . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	What is it m is that the speaker we were t 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	I don't know what it is . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	I don't know it uh either . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	I don't know . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Okay , we went for the double-curved case 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	I guess that's what we were 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well , special colour . . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	but I think w uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	I don't know if it's very special . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	I don't 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Standard rubber . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Alright , that's okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	St 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	isn't it ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Whoa , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	it's a little 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Well that's bit of a problem , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	That's huge . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	No . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	We have the simplest buttons . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	No , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	I don't think so , because it says amount . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	If you use a scroll-wheel 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Ah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah , it wouldn't 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	The the the yellow row is the amount of 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	I don't know . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	I 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	You can have f four kind of push-buttons . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Rubber . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Uh , one til nine . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	You can have uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Is that one or is that nine buttons ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	And I count them like this . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Because Oh , this is 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	oh , this is one , okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Twelve , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.292	okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	To n 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	as uh uh uh separate buttons . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	that's total of four buttons . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Different , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	I think that 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Eighteen . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	One two three four five , si 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Why is that so uh expensive . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Yeah , I don't understand . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Fifty cents for one single stupid button . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	So , whe when you so then it 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	No way . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Here , now it's now it's already s 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah , exactly . Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	shall we just 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	give our own interpretation to , 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	because else we would really have a problem . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	It would be impossible to make it 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	I can't 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	It's way 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304	And and less buttons than this isn't possible . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah , yeah , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	And then throw it 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	This is the most simple 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	No , no no . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	yeah , it is possible , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	but I've never seen one before . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	But whe 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	No , really . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah , uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Yeah , we could skip the numbers . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	but but 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	That's still four . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Uh , it's it's still for little children . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	They can handle that remote control , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	but but it isn't fo 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yes , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	it's for it's li uh it's just for a little 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah , that's no option , that's no option . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Okay , we'll we'll just 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Tha w Le 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	We'll give the buttons special colour . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	We'll give them a special form . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.321	because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	A special colour , why a special colour ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	But wha what s what special ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Otherwise , it 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.323	I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Otherwise it would be the 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	I don't think the special form is really true . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Uh , yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.324	I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.325	making it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Special form also , it says . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Yeah , special material r also , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Is it ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.327	because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	What is the normal material ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah , I dunno . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Plastic . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Sh yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Plastic , I think . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Classic ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Plastic . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Plastic . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Oh , plastic . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.328	'Kay , but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.329	but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Separately . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Se no no no . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	yes . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	And and 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	but we don't have to tell it , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.333	It uh but it 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.334	then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.335	but we can 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.336	but then you still have to use 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.337	we have to find out what chip we u need . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah , I really don't get it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.338	I think we can agree on this . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.339	I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.340	'Cause I think we uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah , yep . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	I think so , too . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Oh , I don't know . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.342	But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.343	Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	And then we can get a docking station . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.344	And maybe then we can do something extra . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	For 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.345	Oh , n uh oh , still 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.346	oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Then we have some money left . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.348	We can put then 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	For two Euros . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.349	We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Uh why ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Yeah , well who knows . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	I mean i i if you 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.351	Or a little bit of tin titanium . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	But what what can we do 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.353	or we can ki do the kinetic cells . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.354	That's also maybe an idea . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.356	Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.357	then we know 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	If if i 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.358	then we exactly know what it will cost us . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.359	Maybe is that 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.360	that's nice to know . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Regular chip and 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Yeah , bu bu but when we 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	I like the hand dynamo part . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.363	yeah , but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.364	because that was our our special feature . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	We'll go back uh tomorrow . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	I mean 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.365	Yeah , okay , you can also do that , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.366	but maybe 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Wi wi without recharge 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.367	It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	I mean , it has a shape . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Of course it has a shape , but i i 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.369	then two Euros isn't even possible . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Why should that not be possible ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.370	Yeah , then 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.371	because then we'd thirty cents left . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	No , 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.372	Yeah , but yeah , I don't know , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.373	because maybe d uh yeah , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.374	we have to find out with the simple chip . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Yes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.375	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.376	and w and and we uh need f 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232	It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.377	and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	It isn't in my information , 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	I uh I 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.378		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.379	You can look at it for s presentation . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.380	S technical functions ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	No . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Uh I've got here in uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	No no , they were uh mine , yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	I will put a I will put a page on it . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.381	Oh . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	When my mouse works again . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.382	Oh , oh oh . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.383	Hey . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.384	Oh . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	My mouse is uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Dead . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Reanimate it . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Oh . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Died . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Ah , I've got it . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	I will put uh my email on the the network . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	What the hell are these ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	It's on it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Oh , whatever . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah , it's open . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.385	Mm . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.386	I don't think here it's in here already . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	It's circuit board . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	It's only just basics for for 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.387	It's nothing about s yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	This isn't helpful . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.388	No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.389	But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.390	Which one was it ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Components design . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.391	Functional requirements ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Um 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	No , that was my presentation . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Components design maybe . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Yes , that was mine . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	N on top . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.392	Ah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.393	Ah yes , it was the second one . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	But that was my second 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.394	Yeah , it was your second 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	It's already open . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.395	your first presentation . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	It's at the bottom . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Working design . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.396	Sorry ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	It's uh at your task bar . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah , but it's the the other one . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Oh . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Mm 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.397	Uh , this is n this is not this n 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Was it working design or components design ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Sorry . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.398	that's not the right one . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.399	I don't 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.400	oh . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Okay , sorry . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.401	No , this is the other one . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.402	Or maybe something is uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.403	maybe there's something abo in in these 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Chip set . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	But this is the same uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	This is o only the possibilities . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.404	Here . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	The display requires an advanced chip . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.405	You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Ah , okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.406	Okay , so we only need a simple chip . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Requires . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	With the light . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.407	No no , that's just a simple chip . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	That's not needed . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.408	A scroll-wheel 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.409	it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.410	So , we don't need any of them . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	L_C_D_ . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	I don't think that uh just a l a little light 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	No . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Yeah , I agree . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.411	And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Yeah , I guess so too . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Yeah , true . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Next channel . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Well , that's not too what we want . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	No . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Well , we might want it , but 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.412	Okay . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	All in twelve Euros . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.413	Back to the costs . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Twelve Euros and fifty cents . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.414	So we're gonna use the simple chip . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So , simple chip is okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Great . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Delete . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	And the lights . Where uh are the lights ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Well , there're three , I guess . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	category . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.415	Nah , there is some money left to be spent . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.416	Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.417	But I mean it isn't 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.418	it hasn't got any innovative technology , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.419	we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.420	I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	But it's original . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.421	But what w is there some extra 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	No , that's true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.422	maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.423	Instead of the rechargeable 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.424	the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	M bu 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.425	Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	But but sometimes you put a 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.426	Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I they will think about that . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.427	I mean if you u 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.428	The uh it's made for s people 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.429	well , the they don't 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.430	if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Uh solar cells are useless . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.431	And i it it th th the the target 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Or the hand dynamo dynamo 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.432	the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.433	Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.434	Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.435	Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Yeah , but but if we ca 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.436	I've never seen it before in a remote control . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	I don't know if 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	But then we could make a docking station . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Five minutes . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.437	No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	That's not true . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.438	Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	We can make a docking station for two thirty . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Wow , w why no li 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.439	we can still make 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Look at now , we got two 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Two thirty . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Fo for a docking station . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	two thirty left . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	We can make a docking station . Sure . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.266	With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Sure . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	I don't know . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	The power device is is i i is very cheap . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.440		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.441	Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Wi with a button to 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Well , we we uh 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	So . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.442	Yeah , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.443	but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.444	I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	Well then it's a useless project . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Look at the case , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.445	Oh , because we 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272	the case the case of of uh of uh 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.446	We well look at all the special stuff we have . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.447	Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.448	It th this is whole concept . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Can't we uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.449	Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Can't we say fifteen Euros ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.450	Uh , no . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349	No , sta yeah I mean 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350	No . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	No , we only make less profit of it . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274	It's the 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	You can sell for twenty seven and a half . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.451	Yeah , I don 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.452	my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.453	and make it uh like a 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.454	Uh uh I I I I still fee 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.455	I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.456	because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	I don't think 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Maybe we can uh can do it both . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354	No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.457	No , that wouldn't n no . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Thirteen twenty . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.458	Yeah , and it is also not a good it's not 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.459	you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	And I think only 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yes , but when it's then when it 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.460	No no . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.461	Yeah , it's great . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.462	No no no . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.463	No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.464	When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.282	You asked for three d 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.283	No , that's n that's not true . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.466	It We can make it yeah no . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.465	Becau be but a remote control gets 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.467	why do they state that this technology can be used if it 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Yes , solar cells are also stated . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.468	Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Why don't we use solar cells then ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.469	Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.470	with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.287	That's true . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Yeah , it's funny for a week . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.361	I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.471	Yeah , but you don't have to . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.472	Trust me . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.473	The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.362	No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.474	Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Oui . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.475	You m have to put something on your box . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.476	You have to make people buy it and uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.477	We can really can do the docking thing , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.478	uh it's not 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.479	yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.289	You can do it for fifty cents . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.290	The c The case the case alone is is is uh 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.480	Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.481	because uh we only have a minute left or so . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.291	the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.292	Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.482	No no , it's not possible . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.483	Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.484	be well then then th it's this is 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.485	then then our concept is ready . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Cheap remote control . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.486	Yeah , we make some extra profit of it . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.364	Yeah . No , we won't , but that's um something else . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.293	But now 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	It w it won't tell , but 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.365	No , this not gonna sell . No . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.487	Huh , any ideas ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.366	Of course not . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	No , uh , n no 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Great . It's great . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Our remote control . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.367	We come back tomorrow , okay ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.488	No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Yes . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	the 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Seventy Euros . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.489	I mean we're gonna 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.490	it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	No , but no . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.491	That's what it's makes it special . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.492	Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.493	and uh I know it will work , 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.494	but uh it's it's an 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.495	They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Why not a hand dynamo then ? 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.496	Okay , well we leave it like this . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.497	Then it's c then we're yeah . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.299		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.368	We can't do anything else . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.369	Warning , finish meeting now . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.300	We're done . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.498	Okay , project e uh 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Is this it ? 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.499	well , we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.370	Yeah , sure . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Okay . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.371	No , we can't . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220		
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.500	Yeah , we have to Yeah , it's 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	No . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.372	Yes , yes . Celebration . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Yes . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.373	I don't see why , but 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Where's the champagne ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.374	I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah ? 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.305	I don't uh hear a bell . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.375	No , not yet . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.306		
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223		
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.376	Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	We can do it here then . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Bye . 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.377	I don't think so . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Can we 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	can't we do it here ? 	
TS3008d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.378	I don't know . I don't I don't think so . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.308		
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Uh-huh . 	
TS3008d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Just fill that one in . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah , we're doing now . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	But it's . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Oh , okay . 	
TS3008d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.501	Uh , I don't know . 	
TS3008d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Nice .
