TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Do you need to change anything on it ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Um Mm , don't think so . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Because otherwise I will already open it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Okay . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Unless uh things have suddenly change again . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Is it much changes ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh don't know . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Uh I didn't No no . I do hot have Only the same information . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Hello , Sebastian . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Hello hello Mister P_M_ .

TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	that's where the thinking goes on . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Oh , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	it's that Roo again , always late . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Bongiorno . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Bongiorno . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I think you should punish him . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	You're the P_M_ . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Hmm . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Punish . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	I see some interesting 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Possibilities , yeah ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	You wish . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	People , welcome back . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Welcome . Uh 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	The third meeting . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Oop . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	If you do not make minutes , no problem , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Um the second thing , um I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	because it works with infrared . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	That's quite strange . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	So 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	We'll come to that later , I g I think . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um the agenda for now 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	No . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Not at all . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	No . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Okay . Um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	we wi we will have your individual presentations , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	uh then the decision on the remote control concept , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	um and uh the closing . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Forty minutes in total for this . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	So um 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	'Kay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Hmm ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Alright . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Oh . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	. 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Just press the okay button , it works . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Um yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	My method ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	How surprising . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Well , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	findings . Uh 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Ease of use is important , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	but uh innovation is more important , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and that they want spongy material . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Uh w wait a sec wait a se 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Oh wait uh wait up . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	uh could you go to the previous slide ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um because I'm taking minutes 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	'Kay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Um were the important themes enclose . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	The feel of to be spongy 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Well , uh 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	one example given was this , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	so um 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Not something dull . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	But they like dark colours , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	you said in the p 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Well 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	then I suggest that 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	the corporate colours are grey and yellow . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	But 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I had 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	But can you can you go back to that slide ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	The uh 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Which one ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	This ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	just one slide back , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	no no no . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and the feel of the material has to be spongy . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Uh well , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	it might . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	But 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Okay , so so , yeah , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	it might not be t uh it 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	it shouldn't be too hard . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	It it 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	maybe it rubber 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	or or 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Yeah , exactly . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	yeah . Okay . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Or we could make oh . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	but that doesn't mean we should use wood , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Okay . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Well , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	this this is an example of what they would like . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	I think we should use soft materials 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	and uh make it colourful 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	that's interesting . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	It's quite interesting . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	o o 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	It's the it's the rubber uh cover . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah , it is , it is i yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	And it's uh colourful . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	It looks likes a banana . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Do you know the phone ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	I don't know the phone , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	but I can imagine it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um thirty five . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Oh , that one , yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	the very 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	And the b 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	the light blue and it's also in yellow . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Yes , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	I I've seen it . I've seen it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	About th 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	I've seen it , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	but 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Okay . Okay . Um uh 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Do you have uh thit that was 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	'Kay . Uh that's about it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Okay , so 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Uh soft material . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	So So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	ease of use is important , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	but technology is twice as important . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And what was even more important ? 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Uh the fancy look and feel . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	that's the most important thing for our customers . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yes . Apparently . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Okay , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Roo , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	could you do your presentation ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	I don't ha really have much to add , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Okay , well 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	These are both with uh with voice recognition , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Shape . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	So I suggest I couldn't uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	But it didn't work . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	My pen didn't load um the information . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	so that's very good . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Slippery . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	s because um 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	You have to grab it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , exactly . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	so you can get a really good grip on it . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	It's it's a lot easier . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	m 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Okay , good . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Great . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Oh and um 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	to add on um Ruud's information , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	and still have the ease of use , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	because we have an easy interface . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Way too much I think for our goal , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Okay , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	b but I think we'll 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	but I'll I'll go into that , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Uh these are the things we've looked at . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	And of course I used the web to uh find my information . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	I'm sorry 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	We have uh a curved one . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	It's uh curved in two dimensions . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	which is curved in three dimension . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	I c 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Right . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	But it's quite uh advanced 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	We can use plastic , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	which is uh very slippery 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and maybe not so nice , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	but you can give it any colour , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	uh which is the same for rubber , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	but it's not slippery . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	We can use wood and titanium . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Well , um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Which brings me to the different energy sources . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Um well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	You really have to imagine like winding up your uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Great . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	I d 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	it would be very new to the market , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	but 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	It would be very new , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Uh Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	this is quite interesting . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	So um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Like the watch . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108		
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	It have it 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	it has to move , that's the the sense of it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	And you can store the energy in the in the thing . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	It's very funny indeed . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I mean solar is of course it's nice , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Indeed . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Um hand dynamo 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	maybe m 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	if uh if you have a watch , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah , I know . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Mm-hmm . Yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	You you walk 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and uh but uh 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	you you're sitting on a couch . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	And wha 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	m 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	it might not work . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	So that's something you have to keep in mind . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	So , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	so we can save on the batteries 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	and otherwise use the batteries . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Okay , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Uh yes , it does . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	I'll come to that later . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	The user interface controls , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	um of course we have the push-buttons 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	and uh we also have scroll-wheels . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	So it's just like a mouse . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	You can scroll 'em , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	you can also push it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	which are just two of these things . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Oh , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yes . That is possible too . Yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	But I th I don't think uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Well 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	I d 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	mayb 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	uh well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	m me neither . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Maybe when you integrate some functions . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	This will be the remote , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	right ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Um with uh maybe a channel selector . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah , uh that's a possibility , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Uh it's do it's done before . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	but 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Because this is how you keep it 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yes . It's quite quite good , yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Volume ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	it's it 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	i 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	A 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	volume , okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	You just use the wheel . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	what about mute ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	About mute . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Thi i i m I guess uh th 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	that that that's one possibility , okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	And click it to muten the device . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	okay . It's quite goods . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	So 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Mm-hmm . Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Um Uh well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Wheel . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	it's obvious obviously new . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	So it might attract uh the young customers . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	But it's done before , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	We use this . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	And Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	it's it's been done years ago 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	and I don't see it anywhere now . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	So maybe it's not no . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	because you gri grab it like this . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Yes , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	but it uses two separate buttons . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	It doesn't use a . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Well . Uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	something for uh Roo here . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	For you too , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Wi within reach . Yes , you have to . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yeah , yeah . Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Sebastian . Um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	because it's all curved . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	So that's a limitation . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	About um the components , uh just the hardware . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	We basically have uh three types of chips we can use 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	which is a little cryptic uh to me . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	you can 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	um I have some information about it . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	So so 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	So 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	that's the sample sensor . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	So if you say mute , it says mute again , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	and then it's um well , I believe it's uh 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	It performs the action . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	So you say mute , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	he repeats mute 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	and you makes a computer sound mute , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	and then goes to the mute function . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Okay . Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Um no op I'm not very sure . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	No , it's not in here . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	which is a bit l little bit more costly . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	which is a bit cheaper . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Okay . Uh well uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	d did we already decide on the display ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	To 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Um no , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah . Well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	I don't have 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	but I don't think information uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	y I don't think you need it on a display . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	No . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	I I don't think either . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	No . I don't think you need it . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	On screen display . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Okay . Okay , well 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Okay 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	th 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	but they seem to like natural uh stuff . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	It's more reliable , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	it's cheaper . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Okay . Good . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Kineti 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	It's it's more advanced , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Okay , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	it's maybe a bit too too flashy , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Otherwise it will not too advanced , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	too 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	uh well . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	because you will save on your batteries . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	But 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	And I think it's more robust . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	It's more uh Uh it's more functional . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah . Okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So if you use titanium 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	No no , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	But but yet , I understood that the market is different . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Oh , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	sorry . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	So um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	and we should uh use wood or something like that . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	And 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	And I would think 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	yeah , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	No , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	the 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	r 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	rubber with colours . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	yeah , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	the older people liked wood . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Oh okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	sorry . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	So it it needs to be rubber . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	No the 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Colourful 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	the younger people liked soft material . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	and 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Okay , spongy materials . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Okay , um well um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	So 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Yes , they can . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	But they really need the regular chip , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	you cannot use the sa simple 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Okay , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	but we also 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	I'm not very sure . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	Maybe that's an uh a different 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	oh , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	But but do we want the curved uh uh design , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	evalu 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	or 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	I think so , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	I 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	it's too dull . Yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	I don't think c our customers will like it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	So I think this is the best of two worlds . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Okay . Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Okay , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Because it it's of cour 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	It's very unlogical . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Well 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	the 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Well 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	there has to be some pointing at . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	But 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	It depends also on your on your 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	but you can point it just to the other wall . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	it depends on your walls actually . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	All lights get absorbed , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Yes , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	So 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	So it has an 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	it's easier . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	And the regular chip . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	I think uh it gives us the advantage of 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	Yes , yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	I like the scroll wheels uh idea . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	No . Think so too . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	So 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	it looks 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	uh yeah , well um 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Technology . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	and I mean L_C_D_ is 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	It's not very flashy and new . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	ok I know , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	but it's m it's less um s standard 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Standard ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	than than 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	That's the problem . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	Yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Mm yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Uh I think our customers will go insane . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Okay , okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	It's it's too much . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah . Okay , I I agree . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	I think i 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	or 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Nah , um n no , I don't think so . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	M 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	No ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Sebast 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	uh nee , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Roo ? Roo , do you have any other 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Um no . Nothing more . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	Nothing more . Um 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Okay . Uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	the n the next phase will be um the um not the 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Sebas 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	what is the next phase f Flores ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	we we need to describe uh decisions now . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	So um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	So i 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	on the energy , well , we decided . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Chip . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	Okay , okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	User interface um 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Yes , they can work . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Sorry , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	They cannot work with double-curved . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Oh , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	sorry . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	That's that's problem . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	I'll check it for you . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	Keep it in mind . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Yes . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	And for you , the product evaluation . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	The project drawing is for the next 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90		
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	it's it's 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Yeah , right . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Yeah ? I can . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Um maybe one of you could write it down . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	I'll do . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	Great . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Um Uh you you need to help me . Um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	W 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	start with the casing . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	The casing is curved , single-curved . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Single-curved . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Okay , single-curved case . Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	What about the energy source ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Traditional batteries uh and solar . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	But can there be uh wor can they work together ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Or do we have to choose between them ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	'Cause if we have to choose 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	No , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	they can be complementary . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	I I think they can . Yes . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Uh al al I uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	yeah ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	Well , uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	What if not ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	Every device 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	It it should be . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	There should be really no problem . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	They can be supplementary . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	That's no problem . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Yeah . Okay , um 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	So 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	So uh uh 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	th 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Battery and solar , yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.349	Okay . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.350	What about uh the finishing of the case ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Yeah , with colourful rubber . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Grey and yellow . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	Grey yellow , okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	Oh , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	I think it's uh it's not very dull . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	It's quite modern actually . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	Don't you think ? 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	I believe the 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	But you have already 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	um you must have a red uh on and off button . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	And um Well well 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	it it doesn't have to be red . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	it should be a full colour cover with such an image 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	Hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	or or 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	Okay . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Or black and yellow . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	Black and yellow , yeah . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	Okay , 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94		
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Well , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	there is . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	Oh , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	I've read . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	Yes . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	with and uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	Yes , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	No . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	They're actually very slow in its techniques . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	Okay , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	So So I'm afraid it's not possible . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	Okay . Um 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	more f more more decisions we made . Um Um 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	A scroll-wheel . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	The scroll-heel . Yes , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	the voice recognition we already decided . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Voice recognition , of course . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	Okay , so 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	scroll-wheel . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	And th the they should be spongy also , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	because they're they're rubber too . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96		
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	What what did you say ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	Well uh 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	you can use 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	So it has th the spongy uh feel also . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	I think rubber is nice . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	Because it uh i 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	I mean what do you touch 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	the button , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	and what do they want 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	spongy uh uh devices , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	b 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	or or i 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	. 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302	Uh is that 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	uh does our our supplier say so ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	It is not uh something uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	it's no information I read about it or so , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	but it's just from 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	No , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	but but uh it 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	You could place a 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	um uh this this would be the button . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	There the icons . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	The scroll-wheel , I mean . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah , b yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	And you could place the indica th th the signals the 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	Yes . 	
TS3011c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So you don't touch the icons that much . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382	That's okay . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah , that's possible , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	No no , there's no painting , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	but but the the plus or the minus . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	Yes , the signs . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	You have to draw the 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	but this is on the pla 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313	yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Yeah , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	it's on the cover . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	So if you uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	You just move the problem . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	Uh I see what you mean . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.385	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.386	maybe that's possible , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.387	because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.388	So maybe they can combine these two . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Yeah . Well actually , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.389	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.390	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	I mean 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.391	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.392	I'm I'm not so sure , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.393	I think it c should be 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Y 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	uh can you separate these uh these 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.394	Well , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.395	I'm not sure , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.396	I have to ask with manufacturing , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.397	but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	and that's what you get with rubber . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.400	So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	I know , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	but do you touch this 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	or do you touch this ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.401	I think both . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	I mean , I I never touch between the buttons . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	I do . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.402	I do . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Or the s uh the sideways . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.403	I think 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Or the the back . Or the back . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	but do you touch between the the these buttons ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	I think 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yes , 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	So you just have it in your hand completely 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	or or i you play with it . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	Okay . Well , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	we do not have very much time uh left . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	Um I guess you two have to figure that out . 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	I'm going to leave the decision to you , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	um because you have to make its prototype , 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	and um yeah 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	y 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	and uh 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Yeah . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.404	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.405	Um not quite . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.406	Um what about uh the chips ? 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.407	We use the regular chip ? 	
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Regular . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.408	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	Yeah .

TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	Okay . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	The chip is is not really 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.414	The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . 	
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	Okay , well . 	
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.415	And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .
