ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	It's Play-Doh . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Play-Doh's edible . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Did you know that ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	It's definitely 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Because kids yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	I used to eat it . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	I've , I've definitely eaten it before . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I didn't know was edible . . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	It's it's chew proof . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	and if it's wasn't edible then 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Well , normal babies . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Actually that makes sense , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Right . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Everybody everybody ready ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yep . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	We've got some . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3		
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	We've got a cool prototype . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Yeah , it's pretty exciting . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	So , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	everything uh that we wanted 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	very simple and easy to use , 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Double curved . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	yeah , double curved , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Nice . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	something that would be different uh , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	separate it from the other remotes out on the market . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	That is cool . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	What's the big blue thing ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	That's the lock button , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	has a L_ L_ on it 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Oh cool . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and then the M_ is a mute button . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	And then it also has digit 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	what button ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um . Oh mute . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	And mute . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	For muting the uh 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	That certainly does . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So you don't you 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . It should be . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Mm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	'S great . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	change that . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Oh it's so cute . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Oh right , yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	They make left-handed scissors , you know . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah , but then 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	but then you can learn to use your right h 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Yes s 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mm . Sure . Sure . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Uh-huh . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I mean it's only pressing buttons , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Imagine d are you right handed ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	I don't think it's too 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Yeah , it's not 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	But we can have both uh 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Have them in stock . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Make 'em more appealing as well . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	But um other than that , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Do you think it says R_R_ ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	I think it does . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Fashion to electronics . Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	. 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	There you go . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So that's that's our end of things 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	wha uh 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	That's 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah , very good , yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	all seems to be there . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Well done . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	And all the playing around is uh 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um before we move on 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , I'm just 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	do you wanna plug in ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I need that cable . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Okay . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Thank you . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah . Um . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	The costs , was that what you said ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Play-Doh is very cheap . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Well , yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	um 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Play-Doh won't last very long 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	But it's edible . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Chew proof . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Uh right . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Okay , now I think we'll do this 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Oh ho-ho . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	so we're going for the kinetic power . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Yep . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Ooh . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	So the case , we've gone for the double curved . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Um 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and it's made out of rubber . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	The interface is push-buttons . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And button supplements 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	well they're in diff special colours , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	aren't they ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So special colours . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	It's better for 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Special form , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And special material . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yep . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Um . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Are they made out of any special material ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Rubber . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	No they're not . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well they're rubber , aren't they ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	The buttons are rubber . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Okay . Right . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So let's see if that comes within budget . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	And it does . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	. 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	That is gonna cost uh 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	We're under budget . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	That's cool . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	this is all very very good . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	The bosses will be very pleased . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Save it in save it in the uh my documents . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	It's already saved , I think . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Splendid . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Okay . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Thank you . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	your evaluation . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Oh , yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	This is where we all get to 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	I get to write on the , oops , on the board . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Right . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Oh . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	'S function 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	F_ eight . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	I love the smell of that Play-Doh . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	I cou . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	have some have some . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	So , evaluation . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	We're gonna do it all together 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	so we evaluate each criteria . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	I've got the criterias . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And the criterias are , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	and I'll draw this up on the board 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	so we have a box 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	. 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	And this is false , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	this is just like to keep you informed . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So the first criteria . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Do you all get what we're doing ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay , cool . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Okay , first criteria , look and feel . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	So what mark should we give for that ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	I would give it a seven . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	As in it's not . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Oh , sorry , one . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Oh sorry , one , d yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	A one . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	A one a one . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Second criteria , new technology . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Have we implemented new technology ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	As in the new high-tech 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	That was our main technological innovation 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	. 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So it's . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So we'll give it a 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Well so the um 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	It's ergonomic , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yeah . Yeah . True . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	So on the technical side of it it 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I'd say it's about a a twoish ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Two . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Two . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	maybe , yeah , I dunno . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Three . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Maybe three , yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	three . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	So criteria three is is it easy to use ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Easy to use . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I think it's a one , I think . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I'd say it's I wouldn't 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	not if you're left-handed it's not . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I would give it a I would give it a two , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Two , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	so it's 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Okay . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Mm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Give it a t give it a two . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	'Kay , criteria four is costs . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Cost . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	It's come in under budget . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	's great . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So that's a definite one . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	That was great . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Amount of buttons . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Like the amount of buttons , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	'cause people like a lot le like 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Contains only the necessary buttons . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	So it's a one ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Um criteria six . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	R_S_I_ is it good against ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Yes s yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yes . Very good . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	So it's anti-R_S_I_ . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	It's one . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And criteria seven , which is the last one , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	does it get lost ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Is it easy to get lost ? 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It's yellow . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	It is very bright , yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	No ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	But it is smallish . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Two . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Maybe it will . Uh . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	T 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	You think it could lost 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	two . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Mm . Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I mean it 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	No , I mean 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I mean , it's not a one , definitely . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Okay . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	But , yeah , it can get lost . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	The mobiles get lost all the time . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Okay , yeah , two is fine . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	But then you ring 'em and you find them . So 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm . Mm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Okay . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah . So , that's that . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So that's the evaluation , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	so I'd say Yay . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	We've , we've done well . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Alright it's all all systems go . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	It's like like a number one . Um . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Number one product . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	We can't fail . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	All done , thanks . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	We fitted all the criterias . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	. 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah , so 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Well done , Reissa . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	So that's that one . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	you know , both individually and as a team . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	psp , you know , especially you two . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	That's all , you know , gone very very well 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	and and 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	and be you know , has been good communication going on . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	just just 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Well . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	You know 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110		
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Fantastic . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Now you guys have been a a great team . 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	It is . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	been cool . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I think So 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I I , you know , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	In four diff 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	in in four meetings . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	They're using our ideas . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Ex exactly that product 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	um thum 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	But um 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	No , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Y 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Oh really ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Or six , uh 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Just start summarising now . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	You can reply to the same message . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I haven't got message . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	See summary , there . If you just reply to that one . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	So there's no way to like predict what our 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	'Cause we had a 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	It was fifty mil fifty million 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Was it was it fifty or five ? 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I don't remember . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	But there's not a way to compute that , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	It gets handed over to another department . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Depends how much we sell . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Uh . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Hmm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	the for the 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	it's another team that actually work out the mai the 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	But we have a vested interest 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	oh yeah , 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	prof profit sharing . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Um . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Yeah , that's it . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	You know , we've we've we've made i we've made 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	We finished an hour earlier . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	we've designed the product , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	we've ma we've got the prototype , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	it's within budget , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	it's does everything that we wanted it to do . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	It's new , it's it's um 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	something that uh that isn't out there already . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm . 	
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Mm . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , 	
ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Definitely . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	it's that it's um , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	hang on , 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	I wrote it down here somewhere 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know ,

ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence .

ES2007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109

ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82		
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39

ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	I mean it's i or in such a new idea . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not 	
ES2007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Yeah . 	
ES2007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .

ES2007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Right ,
