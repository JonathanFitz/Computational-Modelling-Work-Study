TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Okay . Uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	good afternoon . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Good afternoon . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	This is our third meeting already . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I hope you enjoyed your lunch . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I did anyway . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um let's see . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Presentation three . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Okay 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	It's the conceptual design meeting . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	you're going to show me in a few minutes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um but first I'll show you the agenda . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Uh first the opening . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Then we have three presentations . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	How we're going to make it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	And then we're closing . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	We have about forty minutes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Uh so I suggest let's get started . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	No ? 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	No . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Everything fine ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	That's nice . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	And we are going to use default materials . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	No ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	These are just the the things we thought of , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	And maybe we can uh work it out . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Sure . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Okay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I'll start off then . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Good luck . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Doh . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	'Kay 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um we've done some market research . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um okay 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	these are some overall findings . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um most important thing is the fancy design . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	'Kay 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	these are some more group specific findings . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Uh the older people prefer dark colours . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um this leads us to some personal preferences . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Just keep it simple 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	and 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	So this would be very important that we at least include these features . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	This is not really 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	That would be all . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Thank you . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Any questions about the the trends ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Any questions ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Mayb 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Mm no . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	No ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Okay , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	we go on to the next one . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Um 'kay um yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	So uh um uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	So 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Uh and uh using a little uh display . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	findings . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	So uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Um uh let's see . Um yeah and Uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	we uh need some uh new a attractive functions 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	So uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um and yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	overall um user-friendly . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	So uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	using uh large large buttons . Um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	So uh uh yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	or A and 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	uh yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Let's see . Uh yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	um just one button to keep it uh simple . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So uh Um Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	and w we have to keep uh in general buttons 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	uh so um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	made a little uh picture of uh it . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Um See . Um yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Uh um you can put it uh on top . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	So uh um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um it's uh quite uh handy place . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	So um and uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	so 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	And that's it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Uh thank you . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Okay . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	About the components design . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	which you just shake and it produces energy . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	So I don't think it's really an option . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	And the chip-set , um it says simple here , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	but it should be advanced , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	but it raises the price 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Form should follow function overall . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	But depends on what we want . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	I think we should disc discuss that . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	And the chip-set uh really should be advanced 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And that's it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Thank you . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Mm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	'Kay . So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	these are the points we have to discuss . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Uh so 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Yes 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	w 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	there there are four options . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	We could use the basic normal battery . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Uh a hand dynamo . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	But I don't think that's really an option . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Uh solar cells . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	But not every room is very light 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Mm . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	so it's not a very good option . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	No . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Or the kinetic energy . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . Okay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	You just 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	You use it and it works . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Nah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yeah . That's true . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Oh . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	get great popularity for our product . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	But 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Um wel 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	what's the function ? 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	. 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yeah 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	you could load up the batteries , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	B b 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Okay 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Uh it's uh just a small display 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	So I believe one battery uh is just enough . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Uh so 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Uh well 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	That's true . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Uh . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	That's safe . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah . That's a good point . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Mm I don't have any information on pricing . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Mm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	'Cause in our earlier um market research , 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah , sure . Go ahead . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Um so 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	it was open here . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	you can see here , our target group would not do that . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	No . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Mm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	I would greatly advise not to do it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	younger people . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	'Kay . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	It's a bit higher percentage , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	but 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Um well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	this is 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Yeah 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	but this is 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	here the question was , would you prefer it . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Easier to use ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	No , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I think that's a good point . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Um well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Okay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	So pretty large . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Because it's just uh some extra information , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	No . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and it's easy to ignore as well . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	And um yeah 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	I think the um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	that brings us back to the energy . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	And much cheaper as well . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	So 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	And that's the best choice . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Okay 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	let me just choose for the battery . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	That brings us to the chip . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Well 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	there isn't any choice there 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	because we're using the the the the display . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Just the advanced . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	So it's gotta be advanced . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	'Kay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	, advanced chip . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	And then we get to the point of the case . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Um as we saw there is not 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	wood is a lot more expensive to produce . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	which they can show off to their grandkids . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Look I've got a new remote control , and uh 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Well 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Uh I dunno . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . That's right . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	if it's just 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	wood-coloured . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Mm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Mm I dunno . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	You don't know ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I'll have to uh research . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	I think so 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	because 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Probably . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Mm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	So um uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	you 'cause 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	uh Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Change the cases . Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	So 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	maybe it's possible uh possibility . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So um um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	you have just to make one um standard um remote control , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	and um yeah you can sell uh few uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	You can sell the cases . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	I think that's a very good option . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Because um then you can advertise as well 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	with the 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Because that's a it's something extra , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	it's something other remotes don't have , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	which we can get a great advantage point . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah that is true . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	We would have to look carefully into the design though . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Costs . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . So 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	So that would 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	you suggest we should design two different telephones 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	I wouldn't design a telephone 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	but 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	no 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Remote . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	one remote , 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Okay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	So , 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	everybody's okay with the changing covers ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	I think that's a good uh good option . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Changing case covers . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Could you explain that a little more ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Well 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	And what would single curved and double curved mean ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	So 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Okay . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	So 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Pick one you like , 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	yes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Mm . Okay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	'Kay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	That's good . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Uh but the form has to be um It has to 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	It's has to be possible to stand up ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Or just only to lie down ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	No 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	just to lie down . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	And the the cover of the the docking station is also 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	We'll go for that . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	on top of the television then ? Or not ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Well 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	or besides it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	And you can just yeah then click it in . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	That's okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Um so 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	on the the board . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Mm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Does somebody have ideas for a form 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	or 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Uh we can just use the regular form of it , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	but it's um not quite uh fancy . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	so you could , so your thumb would be easily 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Well uh 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	I think that was a very good point 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	So that would be great for that . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	For uh Uh for 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	For left-handed users also . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Yep . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Mm . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	we 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	For the volume . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Or Or isn't it ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Um well 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Mm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	that could 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	we could do that 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Usabili 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	and then it's 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Uh . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176		
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Mm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	but 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	But you have extra buttons . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	So people can get confused . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	That is true . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Especially if they have the same writings on it . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	See um yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Or we have to make a left uh For lefties 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	and 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	functions as the normal one ? 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	You mean um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Then you have to 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	if 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Let's see if I ca 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	A blank one . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	And then you get 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Uh now I have to think . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	It's a plus and a min . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	No it's not very handy I think . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Mm no . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Because the plus and the min will be opposite 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	and all kinds of 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	No that's not gonna work . I guess . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Maybe we should 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	I think the functions are 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . That is true . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	or 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	It's just uh u using uh your thumb . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Y yeah . Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	it's 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Um 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	I think we should start by by choosing a case . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Because that's the basis you're building on . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Um yeah 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	So 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	I could draw them out . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	just 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Let's look at the flat case . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Oh . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	It's from the side 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	so it's rather normal . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	So 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	this type should be better for you 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Easier ? 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Mm . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	So 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	th those are the three options we have . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	'Kay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Mm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	I suggest um the single curved , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	and at the same time look easily at the screen , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Do you say this 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	um S uh Uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	you got like uh sort of a I believe There ? 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Yeah . I think so . Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Um Yeah . Uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	But now it's 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	we can make it um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Do you have it upside down 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	or 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Mm ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Do you have it 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	That's the top . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	So uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	this that's top ? Okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	this top . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	This down . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	um Let's see . Um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Colour uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	So um 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Uh it's an 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	So so 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	the remote control have to um lay in your hand . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	So uh 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	it's possib um yeah for s so and 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	get your mouse . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Yeah . That's a good one . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	Uh rem 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	then you get here . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	but this place um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	If you can have this one , you turn it like this . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	And then flip it upside down . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Uh it's 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	I dunno um 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	It's more logical to have it on top as well 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	I think i 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Yeah 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	so 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	On top . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Oh 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	maybe you should just s start on a blank page . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	. So 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	then we get 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	Here's 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	That's the curve . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Five minutes . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Here the display , and then buttons . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	And then h the rest of the buttons over here . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	Yeah still here 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	jus 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	That's 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah . 'Kay . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Think that would be better . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	Should be more bit more friendly , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Friendly on the eye . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	'Kay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	Supplements . That's okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	Where's my mouse ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	So now 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	So check out the corporate website maybe . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	The user interface design , it's the same story . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	And product evaluation . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Okay . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158		
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220		
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94		
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Which are 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	Uh let's see . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	or 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	And then you'll get a message . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	that's uh basically it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Maybe this one ? 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Then we can save this one in the folders group . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Uh yes , it's here . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	SMARTboard , there it it . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	So 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	Yeah . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . 	
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	Thank you . 	
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Very good . 	
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Okay . 	
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Okay .
