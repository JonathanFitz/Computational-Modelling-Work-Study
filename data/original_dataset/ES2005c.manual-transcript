$d@nite:id	$d	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Um we are 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Okay . Cool . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	are particularly bothering you ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Mm um . No , I don't think so . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	N 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	No ? Okay , cool . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	No . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Hi , me Raj , again . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	So we have to look on this . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	First of all methodology . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	So what are our findings ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	In our 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	uh in our findings we have seen that 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	So we should take into uh 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	we should consider this factor as the most important factor , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	because this factor is twice as important , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	The last one is the most important one , is it ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	No the first one is the 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Oh , sorry . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	the fancy design 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So that indicates our technological advancement . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	And it should be uh 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	So that they could know how to use these remote controls . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Sorry . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Ah yeah ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	I was just reading fruit and vegetables . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Y yeah uh yeah , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	we have to , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	becoming more and more organic , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	becoming 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	We should make a big sponge lemon , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	and then it'd be it would be yellow . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Th that's very good . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	It's 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So something like that we we should do . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Glow-in-the-dark . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	And people uh 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Well , that's good . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	That's what we kind of predicted anyway . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So that should also be taken into consideration . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	So these are my views . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	you can 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	No it ca y a 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Quite disposable . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Oh okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Alright , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	so we don't want to have any harm to the society , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	so 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Fashion . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Cool . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	So that's all . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Fruit and veg , well there you go . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	A remote control ? Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	S uh we didn't find out any such point . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Or was it just 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Mm-mm-mm-mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Cool . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	F_ , what is it ? Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Function F_ eight . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	No signal . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Oh no , . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Is that ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	No , it's got it's got it . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Excuse me . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	and then F_ five , right ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Uh , yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Okay . Um 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	okay , so the interface concept um . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . The interface specification , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	what people 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	um how they interact with it basically , I think . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	what are the 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	what's good about them , what's bad about them , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	um I looked at their flaws , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	so a bit of imagination . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	either . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Uh okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So I think for our remote control 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	like the the top right for on and off or something , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Right , okay . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Excellent . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh no just escape 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Escape , okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	should uh 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Wow . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	I'll just walk you through them . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	This one is a voice recognition . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	And that's the kind of idea we're going for . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	'Kay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Looks pretty complicated . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	There's um an L_C_D_ thing , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	which we thought could 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Right , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm-hmm , like the middle button . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	which 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	like would the computer come 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Ah it's kinda like scrolling 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	uh right , well , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	is it ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Right , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Yeah , presumably . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I think that's what that is . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	So these are just a few ideas . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh it looks threatening . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	It looks like 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Um this one I thought was really cool . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	You can put it in there , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	it's for your kids , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and it's quite an organic shape 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	and the little circle around there is pretty cool . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	And that's really easy to use , bright , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	so I like this one lot for our design . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I think something like that would be good . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Wow . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Of course yellow . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Right , yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah , that's true . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	And this one , the over-sized one , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	I don't think that will sell very well . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I guess so . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I don't know . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	I think that's a bit 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Strange . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah exactly . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No they do , they do . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	They listen to it . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	They do ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	And um this one is just pointing out . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Right , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	So that could 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	that's a bit confusing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Um but the buttons on this I think are 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	They don't have to be all the same . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	So that's quite cool . Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	'Kay 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah , exactly . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um F_ five . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yes . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	So there are some of the findings . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So we need to combine those ones um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Brilliant . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	That's handy . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Um so 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	It's 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	so that's 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	And it's much 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So that's quite cool . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Uh personal preferences just some imagination , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	the raised symbols I thought were good , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	The L_C_D_ 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	and the other stuff 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	uh , I think . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	And the speech recognition , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	are we ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Uh-huh . But our budget , we've 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Uh yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Ben bana 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I can't see tha 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	The L_C_D_ . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	so maybe the small 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	No . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	w I ju I mean 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Yeah . S 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I wouldn't know about the costs of them . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Twelve fifty . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	And the 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Possibly . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah , that's the thing , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	because 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	right ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	You're looking at the T_V_ 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and and it's uh 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	That's true , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	It just seems kind of like a a needless th 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Right . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	It's a it's great , it's a good idea , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Child-friendly , I thought this was good , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	as you pointed out the um 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	but it's a good shape 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	and the organic is kind of 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So which vegetable ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Well I mean we could make a 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Yeah , I know , carrot . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	The the lemon . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Well what are the options ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	But we don't want it to be 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Um the child-friendly , yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	I think that's a good idea to go for . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	I like I like the colourful buttons as well . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	so most people 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	will have come in contact with that kind of use . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	S yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So they'd be able to use that um , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Um so there you go . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Oh . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	So that's um the user interface 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	'Kay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	design . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.199	So okay , I'll take this out now then . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um so 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.200	There you go . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah , looks like it . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Mm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Uh 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	just 'cause we haven't used it . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Right . So , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	and then we'll throw in our new innovations um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	and keep it all within budget . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Magic man . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Um this is what they sent me . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	and there's a a chip , a processor , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and ch 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Right , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	it's very 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	they're very cheap remote . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	This remote costs nothing , you know . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Right . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Oh here it is . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	because it it defines the uh 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	They gotta be 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Almost a key-ring . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Right . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So this is what we need to have for certain . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	amplifier and transmitter are all standard . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	um latex , double-curved , curved . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	So lots of choices , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	'Kay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	what do we think ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Well . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Organic sponge . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	doesn't it . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	And that would k also give it kinda durability 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	and 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Yeah 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	so 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Okay so , here are a a plastic , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	uh latex 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Oh right , okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Oh right . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	I don't know what that stuff is . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So something with give to it . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	And 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	and the colour is yellow , right ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Or at least incorporating , yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	y yellow incorporated , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Yellow , okay . Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	I don't know what other standard silver kind of 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	I think 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Mm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Other parts or uh 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah , the buttons 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	or i if we're having buttons actually , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm' kay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	So yellow for the body , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	I don 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Um . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	and then what colour for the buttons ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	So multi-coloured buttons . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Makes it easy to use . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah , that's true , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	because that blue one did look quite hardish . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I mean if we are gonna make it a novel 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	a bit comfier , you know . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Maybe double 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Like uh an hour glass kind of figure , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	is that what you're thinking of , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	or just like a 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	It's not 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	What about a banana ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	We could make novelty remote controls . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Well , yeah , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	I mean like 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	'cause it's yellow fruit , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	right ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	But then how would you point it ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Ah 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	yeah . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238	How would you point it ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239	What 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah , I appreciate this idea , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	They only cost pennies . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	because then this this will help us in our advertisement also 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	That what our data shows that , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	so this w this w 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Huh ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Um . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	So a spongy banana re 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	I mean that that th 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Rubber banana . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	does 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	And what else did you say about fashions ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	What was trendy ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	S 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	See 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	like people uh now 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	And sponginess . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	And spongy , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Spongy . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	like so it would have a stem perhaps 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	and a 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Maybe , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Huh . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Like what's what's that , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	I don't even know the name of it , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	I don't know the name of that . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	So it'd look like this kinda . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Uh . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah , maybe that's what they are . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	and 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah , why the hell not . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Let's 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	I don't know . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	that'll make us fifty million Euros . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	What do you guy What do you think ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Um . Well , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	I guess it's kind of dra uh 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	No . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	yeah ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Yeah . Exactly . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	There's a good man . There's a good idea . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	We'll uh 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Okay , we could do that . Um . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Um I l I su 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Mm . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Okay , so 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	so buttons . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	things that are always used . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay , just like that . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	That's cool . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	I like it . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Um . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	With the scroll-wheel or no ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Uh speech recognition , I think , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	so we need a microphone presumably . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Okay 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	uh I could put the microphone here . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	Okay there's the microphone . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Where should I put the microphone ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	I mean ho h h wel 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah , I'm not sure . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Glad , we're not doing this for real . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Um yeah , I can 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	no I'm not sure . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	I couldn 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	'Kay there's the mic . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So it can be sort of held and w 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	That's cool . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Um n well we can 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Whoops . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Oops . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Um . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	So let's not use the whiteboard any more . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Upsidaisy . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Oops , sorry . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	And uh so what else was there ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Um the 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Are we just gonna leave that ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	I s I still like it . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Um but that's me . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	You still like it . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Right . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	'Cause um it could 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Um don't wanna sort of overkill . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Especially with yellow . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Mm . I dunno . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	'Cause I mean like uh if we 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Do we want to go for buttons at all , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205	do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	They can work from a 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	you know , and then you just tal 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208	I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	You don't have to hold it . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Um . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	you know they have uh fruits all round them . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	I mean uh some uh I 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah , do we need buttons ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Mm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Then it's just apple so sort of 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Uh , yellow apples though Hmm . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Groovy . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Okay . But yeah 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Um 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah , . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221	So I mean like you could actually 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Yeah , gives you the options . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Or we can 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	we can do one thing , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	So a selection of casings . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	it will look l 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Uh yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	In that w 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	'cause you said about disposable , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	didn't you ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	S s sorry ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	You said about disposable earli people want disposable things 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	so we could do that , like have a choice . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	okay ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Like like mobiles , yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	It will give apple shape look . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	without uh yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	We still need the buttons in the same places thought , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	don't we ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	You can standardise those , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229	I mean . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	so half of that will be look the 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah , not not the upper side . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	So from lower you can , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Okay , okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	And 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231	'cause when 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232	if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Mm mm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.235	And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Maybe . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay , um so 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135		
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	s I guess we decided on material , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	right ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	and the colours we got down , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Well , um because 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	and uh because what 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Okay , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241	so we stick with what we've got there . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	w I think wh wha would 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	They wanted something that looks fancy 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245	So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246	colour , but have 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	kinda going round , yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Because 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Um I mean e even if 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	Uh-huh . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	W sort of 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Great . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	but we don't have to be limited by that . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	We can use a hand-dynamo . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Um I don't know what that means , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	we crank it ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Right , it's like those watches that you c 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Uh yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Oh , a d a dynamo ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah , . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah , I like that , yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137		
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Yeah that's quite cool . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Okay . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	But 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257	You shake it and scream at it . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Yeah , it is , yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	It does leave them with an obligation to 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Yeah , to 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	mo Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Then if it's just sitting on the 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	because most of the people 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Right . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Okay , okay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.363	That's true . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Right um what are the other options ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Uh there's solar power . Um . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	and the days when there is no sola sunlight 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.266	I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.267	I think , you know , 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Okay , so probably just 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.364		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.268	I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	What we w 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.365	But w like just normal light ? 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Oh that's true . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	They can they can recharge it . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.366		
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.270	I mean I w I w uh 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271	that idea that I thought 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272	um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Mm . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.369	And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	is having a , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.275	yeah , 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274	having a rechargeable stand , 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.367	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	'Kay . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.371	Like like a hand 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.372	like one of those portable phones kind of thing . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yeah that kind of thing . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah , that's Yeah , exactly . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Okay . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	So uh a rechargeable battery . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Okay . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Rechargeable . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.373	Mm . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281	. What's chip on print ? 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Um . 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.282	What's 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Hmm ? 	
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Sorry , never mind . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Uh th the uh 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	the electronics um , basically the more features we add um 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Oops , this one . 	
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , 	
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.374	Mm-hmm .
