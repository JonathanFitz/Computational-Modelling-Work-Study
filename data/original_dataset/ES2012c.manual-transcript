ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Alright ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Alright . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Um they've got lots of buttons on them 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	that uh people don't use 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and find difficult to learn . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um and people lose them . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	That 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Okay . So 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Um now the the the internal chip 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Uh I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I'm I'm I'm 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	n not an expert on these things , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	and uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	whether we p um go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Uh so , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	if if we can have the the three presentations again please , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Okay . Um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Kate . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um p there we go . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56		
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	'Kay , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	I'll just be talking about the components design . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	And 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Okay , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and then this is translated uh into uh light signals 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	which are then seen by the T_V_ . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and this creates a a connection within the the remote 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	that allows the chip 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	the chip then senses this connection 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	and produces a signal in a Morse code format . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	This signal's sent to the transistor 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	which amplifies it 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and then sends it on to the light emitting diode 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	and uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	which is then trai changed into a infrared light 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	which is sent to the T_V_ 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and sort of seen by the T_V_ 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	and which uh changes the channels . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Um . Oh . Uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	cool . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Uh so 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	and uh raise the production cost . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	That's something we should think about . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Also we have to work within the company constraints , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	and we could still keep that original idea . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Um , however that's gonna cost more , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	which haven't really been used much on remotes , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Okay , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	And that pretty much sums it up . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	so how um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	sorry , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Mm . Oh yep , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	sorry . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Yep . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Uh d d d 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	okay , I mean uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Mm . Um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Do we do we know uh by how much ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	I don't actually have any price information , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	no . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Um 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	it 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Oh w yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	we did the 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Right , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	uh so it would uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	it's hard to predict the time . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Right , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	I think we need to make a a decision here . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I just have a question about that . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	it's like to have a certain number of favourites um 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	W 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and that w 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Okay . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Then it doesn't matter . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	but to actually the 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So uh um I mean 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	I d d 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	for slightly different 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	well no , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	I mean , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	it's 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	if you you 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	so uh bu I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	the this 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	this information is from is 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	this is the internal company information , is it ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Uh bits of it , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	So uh 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Yes , as well . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	you know , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	hundred and fifty pounds or something . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah , mm true , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	uh decide . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah , that's that's right . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	It's like it's it's you can't 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	'cause mobile phones are expensive , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	But we don't know . Um . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	I mean uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	I su i 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	if 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	given that the um the technology is not well developed 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	and and given that it's it's never been done before , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	um th th the double risk , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Thoughts ? 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Well , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	another thought I 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Would 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	oh , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	sorry , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	go ahead . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Oh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Uh it's fundament 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	well I mean 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	so I think you have to 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I mean I think we 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Oh yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Mm . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Hm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Well , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I I I I I think that's uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	And we've been talking about it the whole time . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Mm , mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Mm , right , okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Uh yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	From uh my presentation show , so . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	it should be 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Uh technologically innovative . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Right , okay , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	so . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	No , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	that sounds good . Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Fine . Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	I 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	it will have voice recognition um uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Mm . Cool . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	second question , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	I think so . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Right . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Sorry , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	d did you want to say anything ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Uh nope , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	No ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	that was it , that was it . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Okay . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Let's see . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Mm . Oh good . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Oh . Yes . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Is it gonna work ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Mm yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	it's thinking about it . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	it'll get there . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yep . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Okay . Okay , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	so I did some research on the internet 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	and um 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	what 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	you know , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	um commands and mechanisms for the operation , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	and there're just kind of a variety of choices . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Um findings , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	so 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	a lot of times they tend to look cluttered 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	There're some special ones available , like this one right here , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	which is marketed towards children , um different designs , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Alright . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	because people some 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	So 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	just kind of minimise the clutter , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	avoid too many buttons 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Mm yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Sorry 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	y y yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	if I can interrupt you . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Well 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	d p 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	'kay , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Uh Uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I think they're they're about the same cost really . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	I I mean , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I think it's just sort of the the 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	there's a lot of slide buttons out there . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Okay , fair enough , fine . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Just because I n 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Good , good . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and then the 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	this is my great little drawing . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	So three three there's three buttons on a slider . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Three buttons , channel up channel up down and 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Y yes , yes . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Well , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Because if it if you no 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	if you know what I mean , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	up like one unit , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	if you see what I mean . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	So it kinda goes up one , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	then y like you can keep rolling it up , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	but it's like like like like a cog or something . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	So you kinda take it up one at a time . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Okay . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	D 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Oh . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	This one on the one side and one 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	yeah . Okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Ye yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	You'd know what you were fiddling with . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	like the shape of it almost like a mouse , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	That was 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	with a 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	we have to come up with is the the actual shape 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Okay , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Um well 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	I was thinking kind of just for the volume , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	of one sort . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Just for the volume , uh . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	but what what do you guys think ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Dep I dunno if it 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	We could 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	depending on the final shape of it , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Fingers , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	'cause if 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	It 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	yeah , I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	B 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	just the way it would 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Mm yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Oh yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	So okay . Right so uh 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	I'm just gonna pass this along . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	that's 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	sorry 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	is that that all you want to say at the mo 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Yes . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	okay , fine . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Mm right . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35		
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Here we go . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Right . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Uh yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	this is my report on trend watching . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	And uh the most important aspect is the l the look 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	it has to look fancy , look and feel 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	uh instead of the current functional look and feel . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	This is a st 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	well 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	So uh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	and the third being easy to use is probably a given , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	we have to try and incorporate , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	so uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Well I I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	I th 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Uh exactly , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Okay . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	I s that out of sequence ? 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Uh yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	sorry . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Uh yeah , and uh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Oh . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Uh sorry , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	clothes , shoes and furniture 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Mm 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	I hadn't thought of that , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	that's different , certainly . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	But uh I was gonna say 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	um yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	What ? 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	I'm just gonna say 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	uh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	f like it's in if if fashion 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	But fashions do don't last very long . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Well 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	and then we can just whip that off and 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Uh . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	Yeah 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Mm , yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	that weird I dunno what that is , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Uh . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	but yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	A kind of 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	Also means you can drop it without damaging it . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Oh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	Uh , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	That's c cool . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah , that's true . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Um you have we could if we could save 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	it's like the old Swatch watch 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Um that's 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Wh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	W I mean we we can uh uh b but 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Mm . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Mm . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	What if we included the batteries in the cover ? 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Oh yeah . I like that . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So um 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	like 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	and 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Yeah , so 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	can I see that thing ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Um . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	S 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Just this as examples . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Yeah , yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	I n I know the only p 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	So f 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Uh yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Yeah , I guess that's 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	and it it it you know , total reliability , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	true . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	but I mean I d I I uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Or well , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	like , you know like th uh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	this bit's the bit you keep , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	and this is the expensive bit , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	this is like the chip 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	and this is the microphone . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	And then this is the power source 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and the bit everyone sees . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	And then 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	I th I s 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Yeah , you probably are right . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	then having getting cheaper production costs 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah , that's true . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Well 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	I mean it is it's up to it's up to 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	So , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	just another five Euro to get 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Right . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Mm , yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	And um 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	that's that's right , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	like they have for mobile phones 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	So uh i so uh okay . Um right , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	sorry . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	Um we hadn't finished your 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Um oh , don't worry 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	it's all said , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	I was just gonna say 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	uh yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	the fashions apply to furniture , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Mm . Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Um this is fashionable . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	This is fashionable 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	with 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	so I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	the the the basic shape i is is what we uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	you know , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Oh yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	mm or uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257	so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258	Yeah 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	uh the the uh or or b 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	like an . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	but I'd 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	yellow seems a bit of a strong colour 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	to make the ent like the thing 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261	I'd I'd um 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	no , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	yeah . Uh no 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	I d I I agree , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264	I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	And make that a fashion symbol as well . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Well 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	n 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Well , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	th this is this is the whole point , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	yes , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	I'm 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Well 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	Mm . Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	So that , you know , when they hold it it's 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	so they could hold on to it , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273	Yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	have the power , wherever , somewhere . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	I mean that was just an idea that I had . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	I mean I've uh yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Oh no 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	that 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	well 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	there's the sim my 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Yeah . Yeah , maybe . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.280	so that you can just sort of ho hold it . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Kind of a c 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	you want something you can definitely grip . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	W it 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	So maybe it'd be 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	I mean well 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Sort of a combination . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	but held , you know , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.284	so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	and fiddle around with it 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	and press it . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Yeah so yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	and then if you had 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	and then it widens up top 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	then wider up here . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	and you can fiddle 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	an 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Yeah , cool . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	What do you guys think about that ? 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	that sounds 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	Okay , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	t 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	we still can just tell it to . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Oh yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	It's a very good point . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	It is a very good point . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	That um the we n 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	we need the the manual controls 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	and that they should be of that form , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	but that uh yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	but you can also bring it up like that 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	Then you just bring it up to your mouth 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	and it's microphone-esque , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	and just speak to it , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	and just say 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.295	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	maybe we cou 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	like 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	w 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	like 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.296	I th I th honest uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Mm I suppose , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	or the contrast needs changing . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.298	It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.299	but they we we're going beyond w w 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Bu 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Hmm yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	Well 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	I mean uh 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.301	Uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.302		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	that's a good idea . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	and and sc 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	I suppose I sup 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	and then you can you can minimise the buttons 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.303	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.304	If we we're 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.305	I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.306	I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	So I guess we could have a menu button as well . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	Yeah 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.307	Uh uh uh 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.308	Okay , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.309	if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.310	Do we need some sort of display ? 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	But the television would be the display 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.311	We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	that 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	things like that usually c pop up on a televi 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	and then y 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	like you hit menu 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	and menu will come up on television 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	and have like tint brightness , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Well I mean 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	on a 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.312	Yep . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah , press that 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	yeah , that's true . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	is t 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	that might work . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	I never understood how that worked though , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.252	but yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.313		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	it's like um 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.253	Yeah , mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	and you could just click that to 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	Mm , oka yeah . Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Uh yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	You know what I mean ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.314	Mm yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.315	Okay , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.316	we got five minutes to go in this meeting , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	Okay . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.317	so um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.318	I d 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.319	I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	Cool . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	So um 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	b b 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	Kate and Kendra now go away 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.256	Play with play-dough . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.257		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Hmm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	but that's a slightly inappropriate word 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.258		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	um to something that we can we can see 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	Yeah , certainly , of course . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Our energy source is gonna be 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	I think I think we decided that we're gonna for 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	long term . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.259	Mm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Cool . Uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	I 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	on the basis that um that , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144		
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	And we're having a custom chip ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	We're having a a custom chip , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	but given the the we've cut the functions down , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	um that will hopefully not be too problematic , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	but given that um technol technological innovation is important , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.261		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.344	then we need to , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	I'll say it again , technologically innovate . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.346	Um and uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.347	we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	And interchangeable case ? 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.348	I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.262	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.351	Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.263	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.352	And uh i you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.353	i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Mm , mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.354	We d we don't know whether 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.355	that to what extent people do it or not , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.356	but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.357	and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.358	then uh 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.359	you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.360	so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.264		
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.361	I won't mention any mention any names , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.362	um it's uh it's good for the supermarket 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.363	and it's good for us 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.364	and it hopefully makes them feel better . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.365	Um the that I mean that's 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.366	no , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.367	because we've got so few buttons 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.368	that it that actually makes that redundant . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Yeah , I think so too . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.265	Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Cool . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	and especially for making them so like different and 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.266	Mm different to feel , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.369	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.267	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.370	And the 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.371	you know , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.372	that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.268	Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.373	'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.374	so no , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.269	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.375	I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.270	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.376	As uh as wide 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.271	Yeah . 	
ES2012c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	As wide as possible . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.377	cer certainly wider angle than than current , 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.378	so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Like this or like this . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.272	Mm yeah . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.379	Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.273		
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190		
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.380	Um yeah , I mean 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.381	I d I th 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.382	I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Yeah , 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.274	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	kinda like this whole 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	Yeah , mm . 	
ES2012c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	So you could use like this and it would go . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.383	Um so 	
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	Mm . 	
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.384	Yeah ,
