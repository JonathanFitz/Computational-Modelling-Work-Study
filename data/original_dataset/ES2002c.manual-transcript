ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.2	so in that sense 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yeah , sure . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	so it does kind of make sense , yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Okay , well 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Everything I have is kinda background . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay we all ready to go ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	And we uh decided on 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um so that was the last meeting . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Is there anything have I forgotten anything ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	No . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Uh that sounds . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Is that everything ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Um so if we have the three presentations , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	That might be a better idea this time . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Sure . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	if that's alright . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Sure . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Yep . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Yeah , cool . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So if you wanna take this . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Why don't I get that ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Screwed in quite tightly . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Uh what did 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Right . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	So um that's kind of the end result hopefully . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um alright so c 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	is it function F_ eight ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Hopefully appear in a wee second . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Come on . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	I think it's working . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Up there we go . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Okay great s so 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	let me just start this . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Okay great . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	So um uh s move on . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Oh no . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	It's not good . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Okay lemme just see where I can find it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	This looks more like it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	I think I just opened up the template . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Sorry about that . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Oh right . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Okay alright so let's have a look here . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Here we go . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Yep . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	so that's why I suggested we get in this . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Aye a fair point definitely . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Number two was that it be innovative . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Aye right . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	because obviously the thing that 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	the message here is ease of use . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	research I have here is on fashion style , okay , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	which as we've agreed is a priority . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	especially in clothes and furniture . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	or we get right into it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	or we completely steer away from it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	do you know what I mean ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Okay okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um 'cause I think what we're in 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	I think that would be pushing it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	So these this is the summary of everything . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	That was like the number three thing . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	that's the way I interpreted it anyway , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	softness in materials , shape , and function , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	You know what a Mac iPod is ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Mm that's true , yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	or more of like a 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Um and then so this is 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Sort of like a 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I dunno like um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	that we agree on , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	uh sorta like a marketing identity . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Does that make sense ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	it's just an idea , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Great . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	So anyway it's just just an idea . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Ah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	How can we build on that ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	covers or something so . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Anyway those are 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	that's all I have , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	That's great . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Okay great . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Um thank you for that . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Uh Craig do you wanna 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	uh plug yours in then ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	Is it working ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Mm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Not quite . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Did you press F_ eight ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	It's probably not sending . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Oh something coming now , yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Yep , there it is . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	There we go . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	And so think of this concept . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	So then this 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	um the shape of the control , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Mm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Um they're not very attractive to look at , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	and they're not very comfortable to hold , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	they're 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	I just hold 'em like big bricks , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	and they're very easily lost . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Um they tend to be very dark colours , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	uh it really should be . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	It's uh something the user then uh identify with . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	but something to look out for . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	and s the other examples of that um 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	The buttons should be large . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	They should be easy to press , very comfortable . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um should avoid s things like that . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah . Okay , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	do we have a corporate colour scheme ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I think it's yellow 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	I didn't know . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And the Play-Doh 's yellow . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Fantastic . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	but keep going 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	and we'll discuss it after . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	they shouldn't be on the um 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	possibly hidden in the the opened up section 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	That's just wrong . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	Mm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Aye that's a good idea , yeah . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	and possibility . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Right and these are problems I've had with it . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Um I don't know where the slogan should go , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	or really what the slogan is . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	I think it's um , fashion into electronics . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Mm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Mm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	That's it . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Cool . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Great . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Lots of good information there . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Yeah that that was very good , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	and uh now with David . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Mm 'kay um . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146		
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	I think I'm cool . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	huh ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Just um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Oops . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Yeah okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Let me just get this going first . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Ah there it is . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It takes a second , doesn't it ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	'Kay , that should be it . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	um and then you can just work through it 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Um the components are exactly the same . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Um like you said time to market was a problem , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	um and how many components are physically in there in cost . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	And the power is basically a factor of that . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	So just go through it in the components . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Um these are the options that are available to you , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Mm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	So maybe if you 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	well I could see the other email that they sent you , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Okay so your basic components are buttons , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Right . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	okay there's an L_C_D_ display , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	um I think these are quite standard things . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	They're standard , aren't they ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	um they're 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	It can actually be flat or it can be curved , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	um and then the different types of materials that you can use , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	um I don't think you can use them in a combination , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	um but um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	I could check back for you , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	but plastic , rubber , and wood , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	so I think that there is some restriction on um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	You know as opposed to two . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	um and that impacts cost . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Power consumption should be about the same . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Um I think the main impact is complexity , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	um and the other thing is um the power options . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Um the first one is a standard battery . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	it's a wind-up you know , a crank . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I'll clear one of these things for you . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Just by moving it yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Yeah 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	but that that might be something 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	I think whatever it is you still need a battery 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102	Mm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	No . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	You know 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	W yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	you know 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Uh yeah yeah , I see . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	You know just to 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	kind of you know just uh you know um so . Um okay 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	I know what you mean yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I think um something comfortable to hold , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	um small and slim 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Um and the other thing is from a production point of view 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Mm-hmm 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.179	mm-hmm 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.180	mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Okay with the titanium case , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	let me just check that um , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.182		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.183	It can't be curved . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	it can't be curved 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	on the wood . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	um especially the titanium 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So um mixing them may not be a good idea 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	um yep . That's it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Right can I 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Uh question on 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.186	can I ask a question ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah well yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	but yeah you c ask away . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Can we uh power a light in this ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Mm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	so that 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.190	So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Well 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.194	I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.195	and that's gonna take battery power , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.196	and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Illuminate the buttons . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah it glows . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	and that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah yeah yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Like a phone , yeah yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Okay cool . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	So you could trigger that to a light , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Sure . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	like I said the bouncing ball thing , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	or you could trigger that to use that to power the light 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	as opposed to 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Right 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	glowingness . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	okay um well 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Okay , great . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um I mean what does everybody think about 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	what are your thoughts on that ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	So something quite curvy ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	Okay 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	um right okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	Colour-wise I mean you made a re 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	uh was it you 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	was that 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Whose 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	I think he made that . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	What's that ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	I don't know . Um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	And then obviously the uh the materials 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	when it 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	That's all . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	you said company colour yellow . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	I mean if we think of something , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	shapes and things . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Does it need with a square thing wha 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Oh you know like in circular in shape or 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Yeah 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Choice of material yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Like fruit . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	See I'm 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	It feels a bit more comfortable , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	into it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.174	And then then we could have curved shapes , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Well I'm 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	No no no not at all . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	no I don't think we do either . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Do you know what I mean ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Okay right well um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	A snowman shape ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	That's quite a distinctive shape , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Right , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	that would be good 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	sure . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	wouldn't it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	so yeah should we go with that ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Do you wanna draw it on the board ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Can you like 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	yeah just t we can visualize it . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Um something like that 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	um you got two groups there um 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Ooh that'd be good . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	or uh you have volume controls about there . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	So call it the snowman-shape trademark . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Yeah that's cool . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	maybe like yellow and white 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	do you want something 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Mm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Okay cool . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	I dunno . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Or when you like 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	I think that might scare me . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I think that'd probably scare me . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	You turn it on your control possessed s . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208	I know . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Um unless an a I mean if you 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Would we put that on the inside or 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	What what's the functionality of that ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Yeah but the question is what are we using it 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	What would it achieve ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	what would we what would we achieve from it ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Well 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	L_C_ well I'd 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Right , okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Mm oh yeah that's true . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	but um it's what's what what would it tell the user , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	I think that would make it very complex . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Mm not real 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	We have the option of the speaker as well 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	I don't know if there is really , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Nah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	no um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	I would say no need for a talk-back . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Uh does anybody disagree with that ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	No . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	You could put a game on it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	No ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Easy . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Mm mm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Okay um right 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	is that what you're thinking ? 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Okay 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	right um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	what else do you need to talk about ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Well i I was just 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Where would you physically position the buttons ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	Um maybe you wanna draw onto the 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Oh sh God 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	we've got five minutes 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	um okay uh 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	back we go . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	sure . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Um I've had kinetic things before , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	I mean what does anybody think about that ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	and watches yeah 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	No , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Sure , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	okay , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	right , okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Support for it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	I mean just 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Yep . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	So we should think about 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	I'm really sorry 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	we don't have as much time as I thought . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Yep . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	Yes yes . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	that feel kind of 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah I think so yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Um just a a lot of the um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291	I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.292	um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Like 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Or even a clear case . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Yeah clear , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Aye that would be a good idea . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Yeah sure . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Um in in a slight subtle way . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Yeah that'd be really good . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Is that what you mean ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Sure . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So the power the battery in that sense , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Sure . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	that sort of 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Yeah they they emanate a light through it . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Yeah 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Lights . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	'Kay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Yeah , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Mm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314	Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Or 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Mm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	If you're holding it in your hand you could 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	That's a very unnatural motion to 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Do you think ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Okay . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Um it might work for volume , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	but not for channels right . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	you've about fifty channels , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	can you imagine trying to . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	okay okay 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	sure . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Mm . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	I dunno . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	But users tend to tend to want to use that 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	and once they lose out on the user experience they're like 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	Uh but 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	But that's not a bad thing is it ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Just 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Jog dials are much easier than that . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Okay 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	You just roll . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	um right well wouldn't it 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Um I'm all for them actually , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	No . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294	And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Yeah 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	like I mean 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Uh-huh . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Uh-huh 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	ooh okay , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	I dunno . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	we really gotta wrap up 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	so yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	It's small , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Okay 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301	well if we can do that , great . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	and that yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.303	Yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.304	let's let's try and get the slogan on there 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.306	um , and 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	And then like a jo 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	So you wanna expand the shape of the 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	like I dunno like here , in with the 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	It would get bumped , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349	it's doesn't really fit with your hand . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Mm . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Mm . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97		
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Right I'm gonna have to 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	A jog di 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.310	I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354	Yeah 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	. It's kind of yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Just for in closing just

ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.315	uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.316	So um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.317	that'll be that'll be good . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Huh . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	Um 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Yeah I think the jog dial , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	you know it just after you drew that , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	what if it was flat and you just spun it , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah that's what I was thinking the 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	that'd be great . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Yep . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	There's lots of space for it um 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.321	Okay . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.322	That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Sure , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.364	yeah , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.365	yeah 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.366	and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.367	and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.325	To make something flush with the case ? 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Something a bit more flush , yeah , 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Okay right . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.369	or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.370	so that it has 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Okay . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.371	and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Sp kinda grippy ? 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Feel like fruit . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Okay . 	
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Fruits kids . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.372	They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	No like 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.373	they're actually just plastic that's textured , 	
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.374	kind of a little bit like 	
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . 	
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Okay
