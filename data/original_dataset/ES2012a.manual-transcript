ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Right 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	um which we want to to build on , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	uh one that everybody wants , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Mm . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	um I'll just go round th the table ,

ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	What's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want ,

ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	please do so . Uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	So we'll start with Andrew . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Oh 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	my name's Andrew 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Right 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	I'm Kendra 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Kendra . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	but I'm m 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	so 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	I'll be working on the design . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Right 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	so . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Right . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Yep , 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	I'm just open to being creative . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Uh I'm Katie , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yep , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	good . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I'm the Industrial Designer 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	and uh 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Okay , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	very very quickly , um this 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I don't want to make this meeting too structured 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Everybody says what they what they want to say , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	The the remote control needs to be original , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	uh I want one , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	User-friendly 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	so we want to make ours one that people can pick up 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I may not need another remote control 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	but uh it's such a nice one 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	I'm gonna have one . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	So 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	I I 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	everybody knows what whiteboard is 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	but le let's go round the table , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	your favourite animal . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Um , badger . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Mm and why ? 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	I feel they're underdog kind of status 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and they're , the 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Oh right 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12		
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	'cause of the the white streaks in it . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um probably a duck 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Kendra . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	I just I li I like the way they look 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	and they're just nice animals 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Right , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	okay . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Uh 's horses , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	no particular reason why . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Uh-huh , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	fair enough yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	I think homo sapien 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15		
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Sorry ? 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	to make T_V_ remotes . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Indeed absolutely yes , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	tha that's um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Okay 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	we're looking at making it at a very good price . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Um , okay , um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Well 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	No . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	and 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	you know . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Are there you know , bad ones they've used 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	or good ones they've used 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	or ones that they've lost and never found again ? 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	like an area that's put a lot of effort into , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	they're very boring , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	very plain . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Like 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	it's very a very 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	like um 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	making a a stylish remote control would be a very like 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um . Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17		
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	So if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	but it makes you think oh . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	So , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	. Yeah 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	sorry 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	that's a bit vague . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	d 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	no 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	people won't see it as a remote control 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	um and uh 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	I think something that's comfortable to hold 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Mm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34		
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	so something that's more comfortable 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	that fits in a person's hand better . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Mm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Mm . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	and s you know some quite fancy ones 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	um than the 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	some from personal experience which look nice 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	but aren't particularly comfortable . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Well 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	from the mouse idea you could , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	which you press , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	whereas if you want 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	could all be flat 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yes , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	I suppose . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	fi find the button buttons easily . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Easily , yeah yeah . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	so you could feel them 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Mm . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Mm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	better . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Yeah , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	that's uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	that's uh certainly be different . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Um do we need it to uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Oh yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Do we do we want uh 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Mm that would be good . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Like a like a mobile phone ? 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Mm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Mm , yeah that would be good . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Mm . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Okay . So , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	which there are already millions out there 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ? 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39		
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27		
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Oh sorry , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	four million of 'em , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	well 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	we could have parallel marketing s schemes 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	and like you just 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	but that might 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	therefore they want it 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	so make it practical at the same time . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	uh but also a device that uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	is practically sound . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm-hmm . Okay , yeah , yeah , well 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	So um , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	I dunno 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	If you . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Mm . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Um okay well 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	first thoughts on um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	the the industrial design side . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Oh 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	'cause it's you depend on them so much , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	but you don't i i it's 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	you don't think of them as a comp 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	like a computer can break down 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	and you're kinda like oh well fair enough 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	there's all these complex things going on , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	it's gonna 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	something's gonna get messed up eventually . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	They they just need to be very very dependable 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	because people sort of take them for granted 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Indeed . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70		
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	it just 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . Uh 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I don't think we should make it too small 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	I 'cause I think it needs to 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	But 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	so 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	yes 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	dependable , and have a good medium range size . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	Okay , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	and um colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ? 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Well , 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	. 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	so maybe we should go with something different 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	or be able to 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	how you can get the different um what are they called ? Like the face-plates 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm , mm-hmm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	that you change 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	so we could have maybe 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	where you can change the face-plates 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	or have kind of a variety 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Uh-huh . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	so people can get different different things . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Right . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	probably just plastic 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	because that's always the lightest . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Okay 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	that's uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Again I don't think that's ever been done before , 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56		
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	might need 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	so . Uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Um , well 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	or with like you buy it with several 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	uh like 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	or as a separate thing , 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	and then forget about it . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Unless you were trying to 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Well 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	you could come up with like novelty ones , 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	I think 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	like they've done with the the mobile phones , 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Mm . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Oh 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	it's 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	and sorta stagger the release of them 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	that's a that's a good idea . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and get people like oh I want that cover on it now 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	and that'll keep them spending money . 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yeah . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Mm-mm . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Right , okay 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Yeah true . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	I think we've got um a good idea now . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	We uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	meeting is uh 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	So uh um 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . 	
ES2012a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Uh thank you very much indeed . 	
ES2012a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	. 	
ES2012a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Okay . 	
ES2012a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Thank you .
