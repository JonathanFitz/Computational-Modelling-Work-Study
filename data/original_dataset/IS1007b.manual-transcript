IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	So we come again for the the second meeting . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Okay . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Okay . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	And we have think I got a new project requirement . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Okay . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	so the remote control should be only used for the the television . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	And of course we should have our image in the in the design . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	So , let's start with the the industrial designer . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yeah , alright . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	. 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	So uh 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Here . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	so I I I think you can reach it from here . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Just go to explorer . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Or open . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Oh okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Participant two . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Participant two . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	This one . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Open uh . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Uh open . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Do you want to open 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Because it's open you mean . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	F_ five . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Slide show , view slide show , . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Ah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	So uh can you go one page down , please . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	So uh mm I'm thin uh 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Okay so can you go down uh 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Did you draw it ? 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Wow . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	This . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	This 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	What is the other chip for ? The one on top . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	One is a communication . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	For men . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	To the in 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	And , that's it . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	What is F_P_G_A_ ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	It's field programmable uh something array . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Gateway arrays . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	It's a field programmable gateway arrays . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Yeah . Programme it . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Uh 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	So this are the they have to work together ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	No . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	And the second one is for the software . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Is the is the software par 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Yeah to run th to make it run . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	alri okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	That's it . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Okay , okay . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	So you can control if you want , right ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	No . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Alright and that's it for the working design . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	So if you have any questions ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Okay , and how about the battery power ? 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Uh no no no no , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	. 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Into the 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	yeah into the t . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	more compact and uh okay , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Mm . Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah , yeah . Okay . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	It's a good idea . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	We just make a small charger 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Uh mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Y yeah , yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and put it 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	That's a good idea . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	You can i yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Ma 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Bu 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	I dunno . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Yeah we can change the b . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Our remote , 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	S okay , so charger for is the . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Um . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	So is mine . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	It's mine . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Oh . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Participant one , no ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Yeah , this your 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Oh we have 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	so let's move to to user interface design . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	So you can open uh 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Participant 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	three . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	So 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	So I'm working on the technical functions design . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	can you show the next slide . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	So so I found on a webs on the internet 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	During the weekend . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	I spent a lot of time searching 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	That's good . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	G 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	so can you 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	This are usual functionality . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Ours is a bit uh different . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	So these are two example . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	One is from 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Tasks . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	This is the most competing prototypes I've found . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	And they are small . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	so it's very lousy . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Of course . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	So you so you move to the next the next one . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah , so I talk about the problem . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	And then I I look at the user manual 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	they are a hundred pages thick , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	so we don't want that . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	You can navigate on T_V_ screen 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	and we can the user's preference 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	and we need some to do some preprocessing . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	than the 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	So we have to t 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	So we should have specific T_V_ ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Or ? We can use this . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Yeah , we don't 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah , I think so . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Yeah , not the T_V_s . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	J j just the remote control . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	So i the processing on on the remote controller 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Yeah , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	we . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Mm . Okay . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Speech recognition . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	N yeah , that's all . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	The next one ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	So I come up with a simple design , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	just keep the v navigation buttons . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Yes , that's a good idea , I think . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Keep the navigation 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	but 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Mm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	It's easy to build , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	it does not consume much power . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	. 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Okay , that's all . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Oh , but you have a catch there , 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Well , then y you you go to the main menu 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	and uh you have uh go to channel 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	and then uh you can 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	No , because you choose by channel , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	so you choose by T_V_ program 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Uh-huh huh huh huh . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Maybe you 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	. 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Mm-hmm hmm hmm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	But 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	So you are 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Ah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Ah , a big jump . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Yeah then yeah that's right . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	A mouse or 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Well , not a mouse 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm hmm hmm . Okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	So , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Mm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	But we'll see . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	How the this remote ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Uh it's gonna be small . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Yeah , of course small . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	So it'll beep if you wanna find it 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	you just uh shout y h just 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah , 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	that's . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	I dunno how bu 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	just give it a name and we call him . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	And responds to you , and 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Okay , so uh next presentation 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Participant four . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	So Harry . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	and the users send the feedbacks , 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	and based on that These are the findings which we got 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	An it does how feasible it is . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	I- mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	We just have the 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	so it's a good idea . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	it's not going to take much space also . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	It's going to be very slim . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	And next one was the size of the remote control . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	It has to be of course a very slim and small one . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	so this is an important criteria here is 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	But 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	I mean we have to look for a trade-off . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	The features and the cost . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Little bit more if it's with extra features . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	It 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	yeah , extra features . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Yeah , yeah . That's right . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Mm . Yeah . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	But is it useful or not u 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Well , uh 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	I don't know . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	There is in the 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Or they say movie name 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	or I don't go for movie names 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Mm , I think 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	I well 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	I think i 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	it will be alright . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	What is the teletext ? 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	If it's necessary can you can do that . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	We can integrate small microphone in the remote 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	so it's not really a problem . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Okay . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	What about lighting adaptive options ? 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Mm . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	It's very complex . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I mean 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	I think it's a bit complex too 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	I think 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Yeah , then we can conclude that . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah , 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	but it's quite possible 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	but maybe not in this project . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Mm-mm . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85		
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	So any things to to discuss ? 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Or any suggestions ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165		
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172		
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	The speech interface 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Expensive . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Price . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	And the lighting adaptation 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	and the teletext . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Mm . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Yeah . Okay . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Mm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	. 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113		
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Function . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	That should be a good uh point . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	I think we we can we 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	is the . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Yes . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Mm . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Because if 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I didn't quite understand 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Yeah , okay . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	We already have some . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	So if we already have it in our remote control 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	So you have to anticipate the the future ? 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah . Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	The future demand , market demand . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Yeah , that's right . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Yeah , to desi 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	well , not not to implement it , 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	The functionality in the future . 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	. 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	In future . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Alright . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Yeah , . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Okay . So 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break , 	
IS1007b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	and we will meet after . 	
IS1007b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Okay , thank you . 	
IS1007b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Okay , thank you . 	
IS1007b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Okay . Thank you .
