IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	sorry 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	the current 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	the n 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	current trends ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Yeah ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Well wha what I found 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	um can you 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Next slide ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Thank you . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	but the most 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Uh also 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes , furniture and all this 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Spongy means eponge ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	What you mean clothe 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Spongy means it it's like sp 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Fruit vegetables is the the new 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	No , I missed that one . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yeah , I I didn't miss an 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	No no , not not yet , not yet . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	So te textu textures , yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	just maybe 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Vegetable textures and all this kind . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Drawings of bananas . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Okay and 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh-huh . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	yeah , yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Well so this is in the next slide certainly . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Uh no no , it's not . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	It's not ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	It's 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	So which fruit are you thinking of ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Um . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	some kind of 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	But yeah it it depends on the 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah maybe the shape the shape 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Apple for channel one . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	So we shouldn't be at re really attached 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	to to the trend 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	but 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	For instance , yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	African or as an elephant ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	That we can discuss afterwards . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	But okay , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	maybe just to fashion gurus , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	but I don't know about 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	because they are more open to new devi new devices 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	To fruit ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	was was able to 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	to buy a a n a cooler remote control . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	But is it uh is fruit cool ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	What ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	That's a question . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	What ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Is fruit cool ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Yeah ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Uh 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	Is the new trend 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	of the 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	imagi 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	just 'cause they have an apple on their 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	No I think we we should think about a a shape with it 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	a device with a shape of some 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	Banana . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	a cucumber . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	I dunno . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Or m 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	Maybe too long . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Maybe . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Too green . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	Maybe . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	A banana . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	Um 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	It's , it 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	I don't th 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	it will be rolling a lot . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Yeah 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Well , this is 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	I think 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So you you you suggest to go f 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	new inputs 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	S so you're simply 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	more things . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	It's not so simple . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	For instance , yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah for for for given an an example yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay good . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	So maybe you can go ahead ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Yeah no , it's what I already said . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Thanks . Um . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Okay , I'll give the floor . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	So you are User Interface guy . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	So you're three ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	And it's this one . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Yep . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	Go for it . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yep . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Okay . So . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	S next uh slide . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	But it's just a speaker right ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	It's 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	no , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	what it is , it's it's very 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	It's not a microphone . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	It has a has a microphone , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	has a speaker , it's got a little chip 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	and it allows you t 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Actually I'm not reading microphone there , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	Sample sensor sample speaker . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	So , I mean , you know , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	But basically the thing is , we have this technology available 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	In-house . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	in-house . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So , um 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	so um it it 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.76	Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	there's something that I unclear really understanding . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	It's it it's no , well , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.78	it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	you say 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.84	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.85	So actually that was a bad example , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.86	'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	So this is not s really to do to to do control . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.87	Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	This is just more like a poi pois yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.88	It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	So it it's c uh it it 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah but you can u 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.77	it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Completely pointless yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Well yeah , that's the thing , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	if 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.99	not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Yeah yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	So 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Yeah , that would be some development work . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	So this is out of discussion . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	M Mando . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Banana-mando . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	No this is mm banana-bando , yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Banana-mando yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Banana-man 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	Uh then it could be cool yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah okay , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	let's go ahead . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105	I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Um , yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	So if we can just move on to the next slide , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	It doesn't look like a banana at all . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Stable thing , that's right . To have , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Mm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	But um , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I've also included this turbo button 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	What's a turbo button ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	and well 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	It con it controls the speed ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	So yeah , that's um , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.136	but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.137	You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.138	I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.139	it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	It's enough . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.140	and it's still very 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.141	it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.142	so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.143	I mean we could have 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.144	well , I guess you need an on and off switch , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Switch on . Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.145	but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	So sounds crazy . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	I like crazy ideas . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	That's why you're a marketing guru . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah , of course . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Well , that's the thing , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	as 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I think that 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	No we can we can't use that . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	You 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	we can ? We can't . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	We can't use that to 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Communicate . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	to comman co communicate , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	it's just a thing 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	It's one way . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	No . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	No ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	you have to be able to to recognize 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	It's not a lot one hundred templates , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Mm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	it's not 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Ah , it's designed for a cof okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Is it design for a coffee machine ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Well that's its current application , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Maybe you could ask your the 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	you could ask the engineering department if we can 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yeah . A good good good thing . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	But uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	You want to g to move to your slides ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah , that's right , yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	You're finished ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Well I just I just made the point , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.160	I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Yeah I think so . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.161	But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.162	you were talking about um being able to find the remote control 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.163	and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	It might be useful to have some kind of base station , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Mm . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Exactly yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.167	but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.168	It's speech 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.169	It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Oh , good idea . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . That's right . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.170	yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Very good . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Okay , let's move on . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So you're two ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	That's right . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	So this is going to be about the component design . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	one is the usual batteries which are there , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	and on top of that we can have solar cells , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	there should be some flexibility in t 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.171	I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	So there should 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	we should think of something like that 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	and then it should be double curve . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	Then controls 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.172	So , just one second , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.173	when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.175	You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.77	Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.176	'cause I'm not sure 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.78	So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Okay , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.178	but like , kind of convex or concave ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.79	So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.80	So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.81	These are the three things , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.82	and there are different materials , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.83	with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.84	So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.85	but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.86	it'll bring the cost down 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.87	and anyway it's 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.183	if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm but i 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	but there is no elasticity 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	which could be 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	Wooden cases 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Well it depends , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.185	I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.186	so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah but the components inside . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.187	it's the inside . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Very too expensive to do . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.189	And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And also uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.190	That's true , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.191	but are we set on the banana idea ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Actually 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Well it look like 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.133	it looks like you are all targeting that 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	I was thinking that the 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.192		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	yeah ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yes it is . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	This 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	Is it an e apple which has 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.193	It's like a pumpkin or 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah ? Pumpkin . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Green . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Green . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137	Green . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Um um um , yes I see . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.195	What does it taste like ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	And you put in the salad . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Pep pepperoni . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Um 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Ah yeah , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.197	is it 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.198	what's it in French ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Poivron . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Oui c'est ca 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Uh pepper . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Pepper . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	But um they do d 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.200	I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	No , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	I mean in a 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	It's not re it 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.201	like with a banana you can have 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	you you think it's really fancy and fun ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	You think that young people that are 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	I'm sure it's fun . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Yeah . More than a banana ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	But banana is not so handy , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Well 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	I think that's handier . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.203	But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.204	and just 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.205	roll it back and forth like that , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It's kind it's kind of it's more uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.206	but with uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.207	I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.208		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Okay let's move on . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	Yeah you're right . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So time is running , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	let's move on . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	just 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	and we we can go ahead with that . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	Yeah , we can go to the next slide . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Then uh there are different kind of chips , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	So we can have regular chip for control . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	And uh regular chip supports speaker support , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.209	So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	It could be a beep kind of thing . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Okay , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.211	but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.213	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.214	So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	As 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	so that 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	That's right . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Okay . Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	So these these were the component selection and these things . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	We can go to the next slide . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Although , if 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Mm . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Of fruits . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Remotes 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	S objects . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.129	objects , okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Crazy objects . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	No but I think just one fruit to control everything . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Like a power fruit . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	and we should have it on the remote . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Well 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay , good . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	So you're having a basis station . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Your 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	usually your remote sits on that . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	So you 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Now let's say 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Bu it's it's . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139	Basis station is with the thing . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	You s you you thing . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	So you're having the basis station and there is a button , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	I think that's a pretty handy feature . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.145	mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	So 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Uh this is 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.147	basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	That's right . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.149	But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.150	So component cost is going to be the least . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	And 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . For better want of a better word 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	you know ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	You think that yellow it's kitsch . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	No , I I 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.157	A yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Well they 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	O otherwise 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Maybe li like that . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.158	It's neither a banana nor a 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Yeah , like this colour this colour 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	Maybe , you know , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	maybe like still in the shape of a banana . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Roughly . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	No , exactly . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162		
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Exactly . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	and just kind of , you know 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Okay . Let's move on . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.159	And uh going to the last slide . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	Uh uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Go for it . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Well no , not not you , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	you can finish your slides before 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Okay , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	so . Anyway , users'll be 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Mm 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.165	So that was very 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	That's it . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	That's all ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Yep . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay , so mm 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	so well done for the presentations . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	and uh where Superman go banana and uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	I do I don't remember you call it ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.171	That's right . The basis station . That's right . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Basis station , yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Uh so um 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	so we're going for a stylish banana shape . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	so , I guess you wanna hold like the way 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Yeah , right . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	So 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	you know , so if you have like 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	What about what about this shape ? More or less . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	We 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	There's less space on this to put with the buttons . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	Yeah , 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	but how many buttons do we need ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Uh what about a 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	So ti time is running , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	we have to we have to we have to to move forward . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Okay , so 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	So we have this . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	So 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	We have a a basis um , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	how do you call it ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	The base station . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	A base station . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Right . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	okay , 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.173	That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	We need b R_F_ to beep . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Okay , so it's uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Basis station . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Basis station , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	thank you . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Alright , so we need uh 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Can you go quickly please ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	and your tur turbo turbo uh button . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	Turbo button . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	Yeah , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	on the th yeah , maybe here . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	so you have 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Yes . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	And and you have two wheels . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Okay right . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Good . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	And , uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	So no L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	No L_C_D_ . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Okay great . Um . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Very good . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Uh for the remote ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Oh , just the switch , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Remotes don't have power on off switch . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Uh so you 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	S no , that'll be controlled by the 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	What a 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	those buttons'll be there already , yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Where ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Means on the remote . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	On the side . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	They are not going to cost you much , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190	everything is in-house 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191	and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Oh , yeah . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	in the first place , you know . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	What about 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	I can't remember , 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Twenty five . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167		
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Twelve point five is the profit on one . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Twenty five . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	Uh forty th four . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	Four millions ? 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Point point four million ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Four point four million . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	Point four million . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	That's a lot of fruit . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	In the market . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279		
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	What about a 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	So . Well . No . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Time is running , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	So , okay , the next step , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	you can come back to your seat . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	to building a prototype , based on this , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	okay ? 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Okay . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	and you have to work on the user interface , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Okay ? 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	It's too difficult . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.173	It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.174	and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253	It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	so t it's in the next prototype 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	so let's skip it . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Uh . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.175	Okay . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	For the future prototypes . 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah , maybe , 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301	That can be the t 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.302	That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . 	
IS1004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Yeah yeah , honour the fruit . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.176	Plus plus , okay . 	
IS1004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.177	Maybe objective banana ? 	
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Okay . 	
IS1004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.303		
IS1004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Thanks very much .
