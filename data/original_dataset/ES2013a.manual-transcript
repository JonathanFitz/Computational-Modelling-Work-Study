ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	it went that-a-way . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Computer adjusting . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Oh . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Uh . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Okay . So . Right . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	You ready back there ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh okay . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Welcome everyone . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	um become acquainted with each other , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	um have a little training on tools , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	uh create a plan , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	discuss things 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Okay . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	The originality um is gonna take all of us . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Um and we'll get on with it . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Okay , so 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Okay ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Right . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	hang on . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	And while you're doing that 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh right , so 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37		
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? Um 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Uh I do not think so , 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Are we all gonna draw a cat ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Only animal I could thin I could draw . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	I know . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Ah . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42		
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Uh-huh . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Okay . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Right , yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Great . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	And the characteristics ? 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	because they're the easiest to draw . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Uh-huh . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	In fact , I'll give it some more 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Oh , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Okay . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and the tail 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Fantastic . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Since you're handy as well , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	why don't you do yours next , Steph . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	I think it's to get us used to using the pen . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Yes . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um sure it's not to test our artistic 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Uh no . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	It's a mouse .

ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64		
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Thanks . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	Oh , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	a fish . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Gosh , 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	A shark ? 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	why didn't I think of fish ? 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	That's even easier to draw than cat . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Mm this is very representational fish . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Oh , okay . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Fine . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Um I like them because they're sleek 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Favourite characteristics ? 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	and they have a lot of freedom 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	but they also do n uh swim in groups , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	so . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	'Kay . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	So 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Do you have a favourite one ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	they have team elements . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	I'm afraid I'm with Steph . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	And I think your pen's running out of whatever . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	and the cat's looking the other way . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	He's hiding . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	Um cats are sometimes very independent . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	My parents had cats . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Okay . Now um 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Um would be an awful lot of these , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Now 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	that's t uh 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	can you do the maths 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and how many are we selling ? 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Uh yeah . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Mark-up ? 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	B 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	yeah . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	But um let me 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Okay . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I have two thoughts . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	One hundred , fifty percent . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yes , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	'cause our market um is international 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	and your problem is has to do with marketing of 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	you know , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	At twenty five . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Yeah , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	that's um 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	So 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	that's four million of them ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Something like that ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Okay . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	That's fifty million Euros . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And if we make 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	That's a lot of selling . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Two four 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Four million . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	To be fifty , be 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	four million . You'd have to sell four million . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Hmm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Okay ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Right . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Experience with a remote control . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	You're both nodding , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	all three . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Well 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	It is true 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33		
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Y yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	And they don't always talk to each other . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Don't know . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36		
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Okay . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Are there any um ideas for the remote ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	What would it be for 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	and what group would be be for ? 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	We have to think about that one . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	We could make a Hello Kitty 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34		
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	themed remote . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129		
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I think one in b bright colours would be good . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	I think one that works would be good . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Well 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Electrical 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	their industrial design is very good . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	Like I've got one at home 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130		
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Well , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	that's a really good point , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Okay . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	you know , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Mm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Mm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Okay . 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	you know , 	
ES2013a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	make everything menus . 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Ooh , 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	closing the meeting . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Yeah . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , 	
ES2013a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	That was quick . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	but the 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	I think that's the industrial design is the first one , 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Mm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	that's Kate , for the working design . 	
ES2013a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	and for marketing the user requirements specification . 	
ES2013a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	I think there's going to be a lot of
