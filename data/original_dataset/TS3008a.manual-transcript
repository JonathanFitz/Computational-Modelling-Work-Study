TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	I'm going to draw a cat . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And you can have them at home . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Well , you can have a piranha at home . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93		
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Ye yes , yeah . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Huh . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	Or a line . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.137		
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	A little bit . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	I mean a bird . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Yeah .

TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.98	cat . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.139	I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25		
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.100		
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	It's 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88		
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.101		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.140	. 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.102		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.141	Okay . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.142	What do you like about it then ? 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Uh it's i most cats are small . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.143	Oh , okay . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	You can handle them . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.103		
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.144	Okay . Okay . Okay , 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Okay . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.145	and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	I wouldn't call it training , but 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.146	Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.147	The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.148	And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.149	We're very ambitious on this one . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.105		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.150	The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.151	and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.152	So that's clear . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.153	Yeah ? 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.106	Okay . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	Alright . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.154	Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.155	well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Or do they annoy you sometimes ? 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Yes . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Hmm . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Different . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.161	Okay . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	uh grouped buttons , you know . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	Different functions of of uh 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	Well , one area or whatever , 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	Okay . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	I think we should group them . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Okay . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	Uh 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	It's what , from my experience . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.110	But isn't it 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	I don't know . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	Okay . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	But we gonna 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	It's only for television , I thought . Not 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	Yes . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	Oh , it is only for televis 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	I thought it was only for television . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yes , it is only for television , but uh 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	So wha what 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Well 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	What wha what uh what document 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	If we think it's useful , we do it . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ? 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Uh , in the email . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	Oh , okay . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	That's right . It's a television remote control . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	I thought it said uh 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , television remote control . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Yes , 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yes , that's uh something extras . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	So we can 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	No , we have to think about that . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	True . Yeah . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	True . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Yep . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	I guess . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Only the experts . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	True . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.185	That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Oh my God . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Okay . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Okay . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.187	Well , other ideas ? 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.188	How can we make it trendy or something ? 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.189	Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? 	
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Uh , to go with to go with fashion and 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.190	Maybe a can opener underneath it ? 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120		
TS3008a.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	For the bear . Uh 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.191	I don't know . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.192	Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	I I uh , no I think it 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , way too high . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	Yep . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	It's international , so we have to use a standard . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.194	Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well that's an idea of course , yeah . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.196	We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.197	original , trendly , and user-friendly 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Hmm . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.199	No , well something trendy and original , 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.200	well that that goes hand in hand I guess . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.201	When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.202	or we should make it combination of that . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.203	'Kay , so you 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Use friendly . 	
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yep . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Well , you know , y like some special feature . 	
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Yeah . 	
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yes , what the market wishes .
