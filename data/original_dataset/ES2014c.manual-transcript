$d@nite:id	$d	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Right . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Conceptual design meeting . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Right . Okay , so 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	but uh it didn't work out too well , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Uh right , so 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Wishing I hadn't closed the damn 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	only as and when required . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	So . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Uh have there been any uh changes ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	I think we all have a presentation again , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	so if we go through those and then um 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Right . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Three presentation , yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	. 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Shall I go first again ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	So 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Yeah , fine . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	I see this a little more smoothly than the last one . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Okay right , let's get started . Um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	basically the uh for the 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Um I'll back actually . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	For the components design , um next step is 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Then there is a chip 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	and still the sender . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	So um yes including the power s supply as well . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	um . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	There's a dynamo . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	um . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	There's a kinetic option , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Um that's one option , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	but I think that was gonna cost a little more . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	which is 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	which may be for the volume . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	You could do do that . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	so we have to take that into consideration . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Um moving on to the printed s 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	What would be the cost do do we know ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Um that's on the next 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	but it does affect the printed circuit board . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Um which is the next section . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	And there's different prices according to each . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	so there is an extra price in that sense . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	um which is the idea of the watches um that you move 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	you move the remote around to power it up . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	And that's it . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	with the printed circuit boards you were going for the 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Thanks . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Um i it kind of depends um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Uh but I don't know , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	so that is something I'll have to look into . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	But are we going f R 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	right . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	We decide . Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	so would it not be best to 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	rather than 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	I mean one way is to do each of the presentations 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	The other way would be to do the presentation 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and then make the decision at that point in time . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Um . Maybe w 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	and then that would be the end of that issue . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Does that make sense ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Yes . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Um I have a lot of the information there . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	It might not be very clear . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Is there 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Unless you want to plug it back in to yours . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Um . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	We could do , yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Um yeah we should . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	it didn't 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	No 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	the scroll wheel required the regular , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	so the 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	if if you down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	which is in the higher price range . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	I think the scroll wheel um 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	The display requires an advanced chip 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Also the display's for something else which we decided against . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Um but that bit 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	so that would keep the price down . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Down . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	I I've got um pictures 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	and they don't really look great . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Right . Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	So maybe just a simple push button , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	and that would cut costs on the 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	So . So we're going for p Okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	So is um 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Simple push button . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	The um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	it was basically what we said before , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	the idea that you record in a set message , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	So it is basically the concept we discussed before . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	I'm guessing it would , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	but got like the definite information . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Or are we going for the regular ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Mm-mm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	But is there any other 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	I mean okay , that's true for the for for that element , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	but we have to take all el elements into consideration . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Mm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	But 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Right . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	it just 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	So maybe that would be something separate , yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	No . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Okay , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	so we'd have a simple circuit board 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Oh that makes sense . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Mm-mm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah that makes sense , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	so we'd stick with the simple circuit board 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	just as a fun way to find it . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Okay . Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Simple circuit board . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Simple push button . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	W w kinetic . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	And it says that 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	I think it said the cost of that isn't too much . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Um yeah 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	And how does it get uh charged up ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	and then that powers it up to use it . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	So the speech recognition was 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Are we going for speech recognition ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	No ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	'Cause that required the advanced 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Um I think it would be helpful to find it , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	but I don't think it'd um 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Just 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Uh yeah I think 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Yeah , I think so . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Just just for the call and find thing . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	It was just 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	I had speech recognition requires advanced 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	req require 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Oh no 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	th that's what that's what I thought , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	but maybe maybe it doesn't . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Um I think I might have got that wrong . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Oh . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	So okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	it's not part of the 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	It's it's just an addition thing 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	it's um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	And so we would want it in as an extra 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	because it doesn't appear to cost too much . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Would that be 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	'Kay shall I pass on to you now ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	I think 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	I'll just just check what it said . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	so like it's already kind of 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	I assume it would cost extra , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	And then have to change all change everything at the last minute . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Okay . S 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Oh , that was quick . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	All of them have a lot of buttons there um 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	they seem to just have the rubber buttons . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Does that move it ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Sorry ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	I've found that 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	try and get it back . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	If you right click 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	and then go onto a previous slide . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Ah it's alright . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Um . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Okay , right . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	And uh it was quite uh a swish model , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Um so that's a bit of competition there . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	So 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	rather than trying to compete with the functions . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	but they don't look as sleek as other models . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	And there's no real advantage 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	On the price , yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	So you were saying the scroll buttons 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Um 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	There was children's remote , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	where um they just had a very limited range of buttons 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	and they were b uh bright and colourful 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	But that's something that's out there . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	and then you could have additional features 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	in you know like a 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	You'd have model one , model two and model three , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	But that's really where your field is . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Anyway you could add on for an extra package , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Right well that's something that we can be aware of . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Is that 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123	So so what are we deciding to do here ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Right . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Uh the fi 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Oh yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	S s so um 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Different languages might not be compatible . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	It w it would make it quite complicated , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	and then the 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Maybe 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	And you were talking 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	unless something else comes up . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Mm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	And you were talking about scroll buttons ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Um yeah 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	and give no real kinda extra benefit 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	b 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	was that right ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Yes yes . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Hmm um 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Okay . So not to be focused on . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Um just to avoid ambiguity . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Um let's think how they did this . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Good in in 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	I'm just gonna check so I do this right . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	An upside-down V_ . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Um . What did they say ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	and that's the first thing that they see 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Actually that can't be right , can it ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Right . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Oh well , no , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	So , be careful what you put on the buttons 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158	So maybe we could have like 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	and be careful of the shape that you make them , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Yeah I I know what you mean . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	So maybe we could have volume written on the side 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	You could have volume up and volume 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Possible . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Volume up , down and Like that . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Mm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	And 'cause the idea was to have limited um 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	it was to have sizable amount of information on it . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Limited number of buttons . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Yeah 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	we got it down to not too many . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Um and I think that's all I had to say for that . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	or are we gonna t 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Oh okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Cool . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	the the one that's the one I talked about last time , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	You know yourself . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	So 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	And second , there should be some technological innovation . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	which is contrary to last year , apparently . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	I presume it must have been not not spongy last year . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	So 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	And then also try and add in technological informat innovation 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	say in the shape of a banana or something like that . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Right , so that'll be it . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Maybe a banana or courgette or something . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	or or you know , do they not matter that much ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	'cause you're can mis-direct people . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	.. . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Maybe just one button , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Maybe that could be a little apple . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Maybe yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124	And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Okay . Now ? Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Stand-by button . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	No 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Well I dunno 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	But what are they gonna be next 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	What are they gonna be next year . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	maybe 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Hmm . S 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	I'm not 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	I don't know . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	to something which is maybe more universal . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Well 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	um even if the design kind of changes , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Ah d d But if 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Well . Yep . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Maybe still with a rubber design we could 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	It was , wasn't it ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	So the 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	And that you can make them curved or double-curved 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Oh yeah yeah 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Oh right , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Um oh no no no 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	that fits , doesn't it ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192	sorry 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	That's the way round . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Which makes sense . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Right . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Rubber buttons require rubber case . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Uh so , yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	you want to basically mint them out 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	and especially 'cause then you could make it something that 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Well , you might be limited in space , that yes . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	would or not . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yes yes . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.206	whether that would just increase the costs , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.207	make it more complicated . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	That's possibly it . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.209	the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.210	so where the buttons would stay the same , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.211	and the general function of the remote would stay the same , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.212	but you could change the the way it looked . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	and then you could have 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Yeah , that's true . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	Yeah 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	you you could do a colour change , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	so therefore you would 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	yeah yeah 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	But uh so 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.215	So it is a possibility , um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	We haven't really seen that yet 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Yes oh that's true 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Oh okay yes 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	uh that might no 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.217	that is 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	It might 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.146	and we might be able to do both 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	but it might clash with certain things . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Well not necessarily , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209	because you could have your company uh 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	We're we're meant to be finishing up . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	You could have your company badge and logo . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214	so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.218	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	So . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.221	And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.222	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111	but I'm 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	people see you with it all about and 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Yeah I suppose , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	i if it 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.224	where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	It's uh in in the house , isn't it , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	I suppose . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	I think 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	So don't change case . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Change case colour . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	And we're sort of saying no to that . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Did we decide on the rubber case ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	The spongy feel , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	or did we think that that might go as a trend ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	Well , it was different last year . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	The trend was different last year apparently . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	It was not not spongy feel . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	But 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	I don't know whether the trend will change . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Yeah , less likely to 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Sounds reasonable . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229		
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.226	So then th th that would 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	so that you could 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.227	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Mm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.228	it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.229	and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	There's flat , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	there's single-curved 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	and there's double-curved . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160	I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.232	Mayb 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.234	But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Well it says that 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163	I'm not exactly sure . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	See how uh 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Let's just get that bigger . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	See how uh the one 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	No 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	you're not connected to me anymore . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	That doesn't help . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.235		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	One one thing to cons 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Shall I just turn it round for time ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136		
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	That should come up . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Mm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.238	So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.239	if we have to kind of 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	So but 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Um it's not very clear up there , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	No . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	Mm yep . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Right . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	I'm not exactl 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.175	I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	That's what I was trying to work out . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243	Oh right . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Shall we 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.240		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245	We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Definitely a single , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178	maybe a double . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.241	'Kay , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.242	so shall we quickly 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.243	We'll go for single curve , yeah . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Okay . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180		
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Okay , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Single curve . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	curved or double curved ? So it's single curved . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.245	So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.246	The one you move around ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Yeah I think that think that's a good idea . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Yep . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.247		
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.182	And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Rubber 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Rubber buttons and case . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.184	but possibly a sticker . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Oh we ca 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Yeah yeah , 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.252	we'll still have the 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.253	Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.254	I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah . Yeah 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Um . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Yes . Yep . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.256	And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Okay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . Or veg . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188	that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Uh what sort of shape do we want ? 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Don't know , 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	maybe just 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ? 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251	As well as 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.252	or w or was that

ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.258	it was just 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253	So it's rubber buttons , 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254	so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons .

ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	so it's not too wacky . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	And the standby button is gonna be different .

ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.192	Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.193	If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160

ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Is it ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.200	once we find out um 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Okay . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.263	And then we're gonna 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.264	are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Just like the 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.266	Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.267	Um . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.268	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.203	'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.269	'Kay . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Mm-hmm .

ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.266	what was that last thing again there ? 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.267	Right much option on that . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.268	I thought you were going for a single curve and 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Ah just the uh shape of the buttons . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Alright . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.270	And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . 	
ES2014c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Yeah . 	
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Fairly sort of self explanatory . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.270	Right , so shape of buttons simple . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Okay . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.272	So that's that , I guess . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.273	We should now go away and get these things sorted out . 	
ES2014c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.275	I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . 	
ES2014c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174
