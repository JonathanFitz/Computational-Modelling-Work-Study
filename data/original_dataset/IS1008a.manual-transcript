IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Uh Okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	What is the goal of the project ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17		
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8		
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Yes , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	is that right ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	Um I was wondering 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Remote controls , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	'cause I had two different things . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Yes . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	we'll start with the remote control for television then . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Uh th most of them ar 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	I don't know 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Mm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	And uh what abo uh 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	and um I uh 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	I thought we were designing a new monitor . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	and um I understood that that was the project goal . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Okay . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	and um that's about uh that's 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Uh for the industrial design ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Yes . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35		
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Okay . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	That's 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Well , you know um , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	So it would really would need to um 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	so um d uh 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	And when would you like that ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	Okay , and it's po 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	B as soon as possible . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Yes I think uh that would be good , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	then we can have the further discussion again . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Yes , of course , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	if you need some help , uh so let me know . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39		
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams . 	
IS1008a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Okay , I'll get back to you on that . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	Yes . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	Thank you . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Okay . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80		
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81		
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	and then it's gotta be simple to use . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	because you know what she is going to do it , okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	and you know how to sell it . Okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	because uh she is doing the design , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	th 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Th That that's 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Very good . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Okay , I can coordinate , 	
IS1008a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Very good . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ? 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Mm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Between uh all the coor 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Well , no , not exactly . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Th Christine , yeah . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Which is 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yes . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Mm-hmm . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	then you will 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Which will also feed into the marketing , 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	Yes . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Yes . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Yeah . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Um , and then 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	I guess build the plan based on all of that , 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	because I think you need to take all the factors into account . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Yep . 	
IS1008a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yeah , of course . 	
IS1008a.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .
