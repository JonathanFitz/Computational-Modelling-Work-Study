ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Okay . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Good morning everybody . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Um I'm glad you could all come . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	I'm really excited to start this team . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	My name is Rose Lindgren . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	I I'll be the Project Manager . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	And then we'll move into the project plan , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	do a little discussion 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	and close , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	since we only have twenty five minutes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	First of all our project aim . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	First the functional design 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	which will be uh first we'll do individual work , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	come into a meeting , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	So that we'll each be doing our own ideas 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	and then coming together 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and um collaborating . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Okay , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	So um , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Um Alima , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Alima . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	sorry 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3		
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	, Alima . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Um we're gonna do a little tool training , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	Um introduce yourself , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	um say one thing about yourself 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	and then draw your favourite animal 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	and tell us about it . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Probably both . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Right , so , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	I have no drawing skills whatsoever . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	But uh let's see , introduce myself . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	My name is Alima Bucciantini . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	I'm doing nationalism studies , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	blah , blah , blah , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	and I have no artistic talents . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	How do you spell your name ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	Thanks . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Oh , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	So 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	let's see if I can get 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5		
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	um here . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	I will draw a little turtle for you all . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	but just that I think they're drawable . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	And you have the pretty little shell going on . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Some little eyes . Happy . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	There you go . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	That's a turtle . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Yes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	So what are your favourite characteristics ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Mm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	um quite decorative little animals , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	they can swim , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	they can , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	they're very adaptable , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	they carry everything they need with them , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	um and they're easy to draw . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Excellent . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1		
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Shall we just go around the table ? 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Uh Okay . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Well , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	my name is Iain uh 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Mm . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	No , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	I'll 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	I should leave that one on there 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	shouldn't I 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	you can erase the turtle , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	before I callously rub it off . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	it's alright . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11		
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39		
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Is that at least identifiable ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Snake . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Well . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	It's a whale , yes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Em 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Well , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	snake ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	It's w 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Thanks . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Um and , yeah , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	like we don't really know much about them 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	or or understand how they work , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	how they form groups . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	And I just find them interesting animals . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Take my contraptions with me . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Alright , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	I'm Jessy . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Don't really know how to draw this . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Just where can I 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	Mm . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Mm . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Maybe if I do the water , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	but how ? 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Sort of give an idea . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	I have no idea how one would explain this . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Mm maybe with some whiskers . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52		
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	You can imagine it in the water . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	I like them , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	because they are like playful and silly sort of 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	have a good time . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Mm 'kay . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Mm 'kay ? 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	I'm Rose 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	and I'm Project Manager , from California . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Um . Hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	S 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Oh , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	a cat . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Um it's actually a coyote . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Let's see . Let's see , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	Right . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	That's impressive . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	That's 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	That's pretty impressive . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Cool . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Oh dear . Yes . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52		
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	We have coyotes howl all the time . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	So I really enjoy their their singing , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Okay um , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	moving on to slightly more serious stuff . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	We're gonna talk about project finances . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Um we have a couple 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	we don't have to worry about specifics . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Okay um , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	so 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and then like another one to get the actual screen on 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	and something else to get it all going , I don't know . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Now they keep combining all different remotes together , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	and I don't know if I necessarily like that 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	I just wanna watch the T_V_ um . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24		
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Hmm . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Always gets lost . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Some sort of like device to help you find it . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	You don't have to get up 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	and walk across the room to change a channel . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Mm . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	I find them 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	they can be a bit annoying , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	they've got too many buttons on them 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	uh too too sort of too sort of complicated 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	change the channel , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	change the volume . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah um . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	I agree with having too many remotes around . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	and I don't know how to work half of them um . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	and that there's not too many buttons , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	they are not too small , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um , I think there is a way around that , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	So 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	What about like batteries and things like that , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	or do all remotes require batteries ? 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Um I would imagine all of them , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	I know . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	but we could 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	something that doesn't 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Mm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Um . Okay , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	So um 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	So how do we work with that ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Mm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	Could we get something that 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	just has 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	No 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	channel changing . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	And maybe that spatially divides it , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Mm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	N that way 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Yeah , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Mm . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Okay , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Um . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Mm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	So like you have to have them somewhere , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Right . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	Can I ask , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	are we designing a remote control for a television only 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Good question . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	I don't know that yet . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Mm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	It's a good question . Um . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	I'll look into that . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Mm-hmm hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	If I can . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	I think it's just T_V_ , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47		
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Mm yeah . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	You know , things might be more advanced than that . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Mm . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90		
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Well , 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	I I don't know if that works technologically or not . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	Yes . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	It's an idea with the buttons being really . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Large . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Mm . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 'Kay 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Mind if we move on ? 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Ps 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97		
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	'Kay . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	mm okay . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . 	
ES2008a.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . 	
ES2008a.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	Mm 'kay um . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Um so very exited to see all your animals 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56

ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Do we know that ? 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	I haven't gotten an agenda yet , 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	um I'll put that together . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	Right . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	and then we'll come back together . 	
ES2008a.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	Yep . 	
ES2008a.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
