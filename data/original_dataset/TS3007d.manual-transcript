TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	So , um no presentation for me . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Afterwards some uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	Yo .

TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Evaluation . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Evaluation . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	Evaluation criteria . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	evaluation 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	s sorry . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Uh evaluation crit criteria . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Uh , in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	which we have to fill in later on . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	Um , you see . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Hmm . Interesting . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Ah , okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Oops . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	So , that's uh that's a big 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Cool . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	l so let's uh wait it uh um 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Some creative uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	we have we have must uh , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Oh . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all uh all this . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	And uh afterwards , uh we closing . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Once again , forty minutes , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	so uh let's start . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	Ok okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	Shall I give a short introduction and then uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	Yeah , well sure . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.9	J_ and J_ . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	J_ and J_ . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	J_ and J_ , okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Jane and Jane . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	'Kay guys , take it away . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	Hi . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	Take it away . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	Um , this was our first concept . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	We decided to use a single touch-screen . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	So , we've worked out this concepts , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	So , we made i it a little bit less thick 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	No ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	This uh isn't nothing . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	Idea maybe uh is better . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	so it's just gonna hold it easily . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	So we began uh working out a concept . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	Well , these would be the main buttons , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	We made a top oh , or a front view . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Just so like you wanna uh back view . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	As you can see , this uh there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	And uh this is for the artistic effect . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	you have more b a better idea after that . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	It won't uh roll around or stuff . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	or like these old uh phones . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	Mm . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Y you you may get the idea . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	like we discussed early on . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	the panel just uh of course goes like this . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	No , okay . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	uh that would 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	you can make a more thinner uh design , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	and that would actually look very nice , yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	And uh , about the colour , what have 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	So , you have room here for your battery 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	and maybe even other um electronic chips . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	Okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Oh yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	It uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	'S l 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	it's like an uh Easter egg . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	We we want a more adult version . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	But , this is like a remote control for children . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	It's called a weemote 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	. A weemote . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	Weemote . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	Weemote . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	Wait what I w got in mind . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Uh , but 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So this actually basic the idea . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	Yeah , I can imagine that . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Those are the technological colours actually , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	so it d 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Or blue or whatever . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	Well , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	um I think a cover is necessary , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	So , there must be some cheap standard cover , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	Hmm . Mm . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	um maybe white or something , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	that's could comes with it and you can buy , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	so we can make extra money . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	Oui okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	The other way around , you mean . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Oh yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Uh-huh . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	They want uh they want more luxury stuff , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	Yeah . Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you're right . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	An another idea . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	They'll please the elder users as well . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Well yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	a colour of 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.53	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	Yes . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	Nah . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	Not not too uh yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	Yeah , exactly . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	Yeah . Or blue or 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Not too , but w a little , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	Ah . Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	because that's our aim . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	li like like this like this . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	Yeah , okay . No . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	. 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	I f 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	Well I I I think so . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	Yeah . The buttons , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	I 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	Yeah , except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	It 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay .

TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	uh something like this would be nice . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	Okay . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	Okay , that's that's it from us .

TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	Opening a Word document now . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	Okay .

TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	The remote control is easy to be found . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	and 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	Fruity . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	Yeah , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.114	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	So , if you so if you have trouble finding it 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	But , um it it's not making any sound uh , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	have we deciding ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Oh , okay , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	but 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.117	So 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.118	It'll make a difference . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.119	We have the better re 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.120	I don't know . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.122	My remote control's black . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	A li little bit maybe ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.123	A little bit , but yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Four ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Fi 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.125	K yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	I 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.126	Fo fo yeah fo five is . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Ah , I I I think five . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	Well , then uh then I'll go for four . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Four ? 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	Yeah , okay , you're right . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	Uh , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	Yes , but five is between four and six . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	I think 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	so I'll I'll go for four . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	Ah , you must see it as 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Wha 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.128	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	B_ . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.129	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	Yeah , that that's a better question actually . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.131	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	it it's 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	Exa 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	I think that that's what it's about . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.132	If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	If it 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	if this lying on your couch , you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	Yeah , yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	So 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.133	Yeah , that's stupid . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122

TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Uh , but when you lost it you're just not 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	But , okay . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	That's our remote control . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.135	Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	Yeah , what is that . Uh ,

TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Well , I don yeah , it is kind of 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.148	Top easy to use ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.149	It's it's not the most easy to use 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.131	It 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.146	No , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.132	No . Uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.147	you can do two , because um 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.150	It can be easier . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.148	it can be easier . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.133	It could yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.149	But then you're l 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.150	yeah , but then you'll lose 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.134	Functional ability . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.151	function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.152	But 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.153	It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	on t 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.135	. 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.154		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.136	No , it's it I I'll go for two . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.155	No . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.137	My vote's on two . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Two ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.156	Yeah , m mine too . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	Okay , two . Yeah , two . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.157	Yeah , but waits just a minutes . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Inspiration . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	What's the time ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.159	These are the m regular remotes . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	Yeah yeah , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	I'm uh hurrying . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	Okay , eleven . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	The remote control is innovative . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	Yeah .

TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	of course . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.139

TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.140	Yes , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	False . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	it 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.164	This is used with speech recognition , this . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	The remote control has built-in games ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.165	Yes . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.166	But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	Yeah , they are built in .

TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	we just put a good battery it it . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.202	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	Mobile phones nowadays . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.203	Daniel . Daniel , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.204	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.205	Yo . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.204	what do you think about Here . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.206	Sorry , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	yeah , yes . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.205	What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.206	just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Mm-hmm . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.207	rechargeable batteries in it and just 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.223	But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , and not really . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.208	Yeah , yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.212	But we 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.213	if you forget about the kinetic , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.209	Just an idea . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.182	Yeah , sure . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.210	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.225	that's a cost reduc 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.215	well if we do that , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.214	we shall . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Ah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.183	Okay , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.216	So um 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.211	Yeah , of course . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.185	And that would solve the budget problem . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just oh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.228	so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.187	It's just yeah well , the single-curve that 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Oh , okay , okay . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	Yeah . Exactly , yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Or are these two curves ? Uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.219	So that's wh tha that's one option . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.220	And then w yeah , and then we could have it , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.214	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.221	but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.213		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	but what else uh do we have to cut out ? 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.192	We going to cut 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.222	No , tho uh that that can be done . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.223	So uh , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.224	okay , a little less uh conversation . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Curvy . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.225	Sorry ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.217	The blue blue uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Fill in 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Just a 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.218	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Explanation . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.228	explanation . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Twelve fifty . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.191		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.229	I can delete it for you if you want . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Well 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.190		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.219	No , no no . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.230	So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.231	And we're done . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	but does it fit with our design ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Do we have to u adapt it ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.232	Uh well , the only uh thing that don't 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	It's single-curves . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.220	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.239	W 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.193	Yeah , we just make it flat . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	Okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.221	But , wha 'Kay , look , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.194	But , you do l 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.222	what is the uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.223	If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	More . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.224	But 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	You make it optional . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.225	No , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.226	but does it have a lot of extra uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.195	Function . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Functional . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.227	fun function more like 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.196	Worth , does it have added worth ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.197	No , um 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.229	Yeah , uh aesthetic . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.230	I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.231	But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	Yeah , well let's assume it is . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah , it is . Oh . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.232	No , we can't go above that . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.233	Yeah ? 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	We we should assume it i that it is . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.234	Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.235	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.238	Do you think ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.236	Yeah , I think so . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Well , now you can shake your remote control . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.240	Kinetic . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	You have standard old battery control uh remote con 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.241	What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Not freaks , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.243	the envi 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.244	No . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.207	True . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.245	I I think it's it's 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.246	It look like this one . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.241	Yeah ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Who 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.243	because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.240		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.244	and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.245	thing . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.246	And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.238		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.247	then it's uh then it's uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah , just one big curve . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.248	yeah , one big good curve . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.205		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.249	I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.206		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.239		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.250	This is strange by the way . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.252	We thought that wood would be more expensive . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.248	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	Uh , this uh American figures . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	You just cut down some trees . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah , maybe . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.255	But uh that 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.256	this is this is it ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.257	Yeah . Okay , this is it . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.249	This is it . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.258	I'm gonna save it . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.259	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yes . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.210	It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.262	No . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.211	That's one of the functionability uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Okay , well , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.261	considering we have 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.250	Ah no , we have to do all those hours again . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.253		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.208		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	Go back . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	One back ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	Costs on uh No redesign . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.209		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.263	We sue . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah , okay , yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.264	We Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Okay , um 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.264	now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Uh , some uh things . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.266	Were there uh room for uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.267	was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	Um 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Hmm . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.257	I I didn't think so . That there was a lot of room for it . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.258	But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.259	It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.260	and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.271	That's true . I agree with that . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.212	Well , I th I think you two , uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.261	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah . That's true . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	For us , there was a lot of creativity . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.213	'Cause I think m 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.267	We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.262	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.214	I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.263	Yeah . Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Uh how about the leadership ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.215	Ha . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.264	Leadership was uh crappy . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.269	Crappy . Cra 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.216	Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.279		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.268	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Okay , thank you very much . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.217	Nah . No , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.218	the leadership was okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.265		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Now we're done . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Yeah , example of crappy leadershi 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.266	No , leadership was uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Okay , yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.267	Okay , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.219	Yeah , it was good . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.269	I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.270	Uh , you could have 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.271	but uh , it was your first , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.272	no uh no disrespect or something , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.273	but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.220		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.283		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.274	So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.273	You could of said , shut up you fool . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.221		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Yeah . I notice it too . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.276	But 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.287	I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	About me . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.288	about the first meeting . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.222		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.289	So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	Yeah , you made up . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.223	Try to learn from your mistake . And we will never do it again . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.290	get better 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.291	and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	No , it you did better . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.274	Yeah , more more consensus . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.275	Ev everybody w was agreeing every 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.292	yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Much more constructive . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Okay , so uh that's cool . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.276	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.294	Uh , teamwork ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Well , maybe that's uh only 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Yeah well , it's for us , because uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.277	Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Yeah 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.278	So , it is a little bit 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.299	and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.279	Yeah . No 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.300	But , really teamwork were you two uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	Two guys . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.280	Well , it went okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.301	The 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.224	Yeah , that went w it went well . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.225	It's it's just uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.281	Stupid stupid pen , but uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.303	No hard feelings . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.226	Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.304		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Now you you must push a little while . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.282	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.283	but but draw something uh difficult . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.227	Yeah , but us 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.228	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.284	D uh just write your name right now . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Try to write your name , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.229		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.286	in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.287	Yeah , normally , uh this uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.288	the w Block letter sign it , yeah ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.308	O Just uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.289	Just just write your name in in one line . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.309	okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.290	If it's a little bit too small 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.291	bit quicker now . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.292	It didn't 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.310	You can be you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.230	Oh . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.311	I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.231		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.294		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.312	so I think that's the that's the main issue . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.313	Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	Means . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.232		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Y well , yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.314	um the the the the digital pen . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Th the i 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.297	The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Okay . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.286	Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.316	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.287	But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.288	but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.317	No . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.298	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.233	No , I have it working . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.234	But , uh yeah , well uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.289	It's it's not real real use for me . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.236	No , it doesn't have that much added value to the 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Huh . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.299	Nee . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Well 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.300	As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.301	because must um 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.320	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.303	I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.321	M yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.322	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.323	And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.324	No , uh that's true . No . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.290	Not really , no . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.325	And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.326	but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly , I think . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.305	Yeah , not user-friendly . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.237	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.291		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.306	Yeah , and it's it's not very precise . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.328	and that's the 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.307	We're trying to m to 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.293	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.294	like when you do this . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Yeah , it may um 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.309	Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.310	Smaller . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.295	Smaller ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.311	Yeah , smaller . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Just like when you're writing on a letter . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Yeah , but that's not th the the you 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.330	when you at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.315	No , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.316	a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.317	It's uh th it it 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Yeah , uh we had more problems even here 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.319	when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.296	Oh . Sorry . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	But maybe there's some function with 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.333	no , it isn't . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.334	With uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.320	And the eraser was another problem . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.321	It w t is is this large . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.322	And when you try to erase this line , y 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.336	Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.323	I'm gonna erase my name there . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.337	Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.297	Okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.298	New ideas ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.324	M Abo What kind of new ideas ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Um 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.299		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.300	Do you ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Yeah , uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.340		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.301	Go on . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.341	I'm just uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.326	New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.302	Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.342	I don't know what what I mean . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.343	No . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.238		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.303		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.327	Hello . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.304	Did you heard what he said ? 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.239	Know what I mean . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.305	I don't 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.306	I don't know what I mean . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.307	Oh , I have some figure . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.240		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.308	Here . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.309	The eva the evaluation , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.344	Oh . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.345	Oh yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.310	the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.346	That's interesting . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.311	So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Okay , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.348	because what does it mean ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.329	So true . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.312	Uh , that uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.349	All the mo yeah , are between one and two . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.313	all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.351	Thank you , expert . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.314		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.241		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.352	But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Not really , just they have to improve it . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Not really , yeah ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Uh , the concept is okay , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.354	Yeah , I think 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.332	but it has to be quicker . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Uh , it is still opening my programme , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.334	n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.335	and it , yeah , just takes too many time . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.336	People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.356	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.357	You had expected it to to be uh more more uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.337	More user-friendly . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.358	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.338	'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.359	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.315	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.339	and you do 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.316	May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.340	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.317	And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.341	Yeah , that l 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.342	Would be easier . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.343	Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.344	just you can write in the way you normally write . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.318	Hmm ? No . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.345	And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.346	And that's a very bad concept . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.362	Yep , yep . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Yeah , that's true . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.319	Ah , very bad . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.347	Nah , okay , I I it's my opinion that I 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.320	But 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.321	I think this is better than regular flip-overs , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.322	but 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Yeah , it's can be saved easier . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.323	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.349	But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.350	There's no text option . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.324	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.351	And writing text uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.364	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.365	and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.366	You have to draw it yourself now . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.353	Or maybe even insert picture . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.325	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.354	If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.367	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.242	Or text function . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.243	Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.355	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.244	Mean 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.326	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.327	but insert image isn't available ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.356	'Cause then you could 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.328	Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.369	Yeah , that that can be done already . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Oh , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.370	But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.358	So you can 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.329	Hyperlink ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.330	Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.359	With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.331	Type type it ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.360	Oh yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.332	Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.361	Maybe . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.371	Hmm ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.333	Yes , is now is okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.372	Sorry ? 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.334	Okay ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.362	You'll just make a link in 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.335	Huh . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.363	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.373	Well , that's nice . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.364	There's one way to uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.374	Is it 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.336	'Kay , double-click it . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.365	Maybe if if you're not using the eraser 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.376	Here . oh . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	You're erasing . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.375	Oh , sorry . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.366	Something else th 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.367	Yeah , arrow . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	Double-click it . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.377	Yeah . Here , that . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.368	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.369	Well , it's 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.378	So you have 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.380	as you saw , you have a little uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.379	Oh , you can 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.382	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.383	thank you . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.384	You can go uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.370	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.385	there . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.386	So there the the the functionality is there , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.387	but it's not it's not ideal , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.371	But 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.388	and it's it's very 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.372	. 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.389	it costs a lot of time to uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.373	To use , yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.390	to use . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.391	And that's a pity , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.392	if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.375	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.376	And that's m 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.393	and we are now with four people , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.394	but it 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.395	well , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.374		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.377	That's mostly the case , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.378	from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.379	and if you have to do all this kind 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.396	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.397	Two minutes of drawing , yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	Yep . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.380	You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.398	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.381	And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.399	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	What I really miss also is uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.245		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.400		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	is a d is a turtle 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	is a decision uh decision system 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.246		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	like um 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.401	Yeah yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.382	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.402	Yeah , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.247	Oh . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.349	Just a little group group decision application . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.403	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.404	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.248	But uh , problem is , well you can't discuss anything 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.249	well you you ca uh you can , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.250	but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.350	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.251	We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.252	But , well uh I we said uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.253	and then you can react uh on it . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.254	But if you you put a three on it , uh just figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.351	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.352	Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.255	Yeah , but it would yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.353	but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.256	Yeah okay , the for processing part . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.356	The digit . Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.259	But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.405		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.357	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.406		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.354		
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.260	Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.358	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.257		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.407	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.359	Okay . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.383	Okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.408	Okay , so 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.384	Yo , manager . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.360	That's it ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.409	Uh well , just about , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.258		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.385	When are w 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.410	because uh

TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.377	Five minutes for finishing . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.442	Um , this is about the functional design , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.443	the things yeah yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.378	Management Expert , you have to change that .

TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.390	It's a read-only version . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.381	Yeah , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.382	but you can save it u the under another name . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.391	Oh , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.447	Marketing Expert , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.448	okay . Um 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.449	about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.450	Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.451	So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.452	yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.383	Maybe um the 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.384		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.392	Uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.385	The 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.454	Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.386	Yeah .

TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.387	You Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.269		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.388	No , you have to put uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.455	Oka okay , okay , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.456	I 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.457	I really didn't knew that . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.390	Oh nay , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.391	a volume changing , second . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.458	So , this one's first . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.393	S switch , yes . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.459	You go there and you go there . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.394	Yeah .

TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.395	Okay , go on . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.461	Well , maybe I can then do it 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.462	one two three . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.396	Yes , very good . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.394	One two three . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.464	If the order is in uh is is uh important , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.397	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.398	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.465	that's the word for . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.399	The order . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.463	Uh , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.392		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.466	then the conceptual design . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.467	Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.468	uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.469	so that's 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.395	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.396	Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.470	Yeah , because yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.471	Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.401	Single-curves . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.400		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.472	Uh , the buttons 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.270	It's not double . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.271	Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.473	Hmm ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.397	A single-curved . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.474	Not double anymore . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.402	No , okay . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.475	Nay but that this is what um 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.272	Yeah , okay . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.403	Was initial , the plan . The initial plan . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.476	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.273	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.477	And the the added functions like Tetris snake , 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.478	it's under the parental control , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.274		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.479	the touch-screen . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.275	On thing uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.480	So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.276	One small thing uh , 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.277	the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.278	I don't think so , eh ? 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.398	Ah , it's very cheap . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.280	It's very cheap . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.481	Uh , it's very cheap , 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.404		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.482	you you maybe you you you you come at uh 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.405	No , it's it's not very cheap , but that 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.399		
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.483	It's very necessary . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.406	no , but it's a development inside corporation . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.279		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.407	Like , uh w we don't have to buy parental control . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.408	Our own people can make that , I think . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.484	Yeah , but it still has some 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.400	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.409	Yeah , it it has some cost , but 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.485	yeah . Okay , 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.401	He'll do it in his free time . So uh 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.486	but so we can discuss that uh 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.281		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.410	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.487	we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh 	
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.402	Of directur or directors . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.488	What's it what's the company called ? 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.489	I just keep forgetting it . 	
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.412	Real Reaction . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.490	Real Real Reaction . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.282		
TS3007d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.411		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.403	Yeah . 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.491	Real Reaction , yeah . 	
TS3007d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.283		
TS3007d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.404	You can ask your personal 	
TS3007d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.492	Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh
