ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Uh it fell off . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	One , two , three , four , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	yeah , we're ready . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Welcome to this second meeting . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Um it's now quarter after twelve 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	This is a meeting on functional design . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Um and I wanna welcome you all 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	and thank you all for doing some research in between . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and I'll show them to you in a moment . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	Um I know each of you have a presentation 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Okay ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	Is this ap 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Yes . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	Oops . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	everybody agree with this ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Yes . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um but uh now 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	for the minutes of the first meeting . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	And go to that one . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	Um as you can see it was this earlier today . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	I opened the meeting , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	the product was developed uh and reviewed , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and we talked about the financial end of it . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	And we closed early 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	Are they complete , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	'Kay . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Uh I think so , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	Did I miss something ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	but yes , we did , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Okay , I accept the minutes . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	So um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	And uh 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Is that what we're supposed to say ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	Yeah , I do . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Good . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Okay ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Mm we need to move this . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	Who wants to go f first ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	That's as far as it goes . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	Oh it doesn't have any on , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	does it ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	That's fine . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Excellent , thank you . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	Oy , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	big loop under the table . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	She said we didn't need to screw it in . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Okay , that looks good . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	It's doing its thing . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	There we are . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	Alright . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Thank you very much . Um . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	So um 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	and to think about menu functionality and current technology 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	So 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Um fifty percent 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	I think of all these uh numbers the most important is 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	And eighty percent of users , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Could can I ask where these figures come from , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	is this market research we've 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	Um it was market research 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	and there were a hundred people in the room , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Now 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	um that teletext is outdated um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	and the internet is coming in as important , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	Well 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	So 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	So 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10		
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	Now 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Very interesting , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	Is that a large enough target market to target it ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	Well , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	To 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Um yes . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Or eight million . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Yes . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	But would you pay more 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	and does it work 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	and is it approachable 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	and and did I know that it was it was an 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	that's a that's a very good question . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Um 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	but I think it's an interesting 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Shall I go back ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	on like how much more it would be 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	and any , you know , existing examples , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	Exactly . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	I mean 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	I I I uh did not receive any information on that , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	and and that wasn't responded to , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	you know , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	so it turns into something 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	You know , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	it's I a and I think , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	you know 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	He must be w one of a s small population . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	No , no , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	you 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	Kate , you're exactly right there . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	and and uh they'll be 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Uh , mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	that's looking at age groups . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Exactly . I yes , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	Leap . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	you know , um so 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	Okay , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	you had the other power channel . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	And this is this is also supported by the market research . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Thank you . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	That's my contribution . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Alright . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	And we'll turn to the next presentation . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	I think she said we don't need to screw it in , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	just stick it in . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	And then press , what ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	F F_N_ and F_ eight . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	Next to the control button on the bottom , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	and then F_ eight at the top . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	Yeah , press them . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	And then w be patient . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	Yeah , here we go . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Tada . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	Can I not just uh do each one in order ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	I you can if you like , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	There we are . Yay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	That ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	no 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	that one , that one there . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	That ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	Left , left a bit , left a bit , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	That ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	that one , yep . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	Right , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	technical functions design . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	Uh well 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	So 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	that's not something I'd thought about at all , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	but it's also something we can discuss . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Okay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	T_V_ only . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	So 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	these are two models of existing remote controls . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Ugh . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	I don't think we need them at all . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	not related to the internet one that you mentioned , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	So 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	it 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	really exceed the requirements , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Okay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	o 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Alright . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Any uh thing else you wanna add ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	No . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Okay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	But we could go back to the pictures of the uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	and possibly discuss what we think about them , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Or if 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	Okay then . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	Whiteboard session . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	Definitely less cluttered 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	and I mean 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	but still it's 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Sorry 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	It's there 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	I was just 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	but it's 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	The the style of these is terrible . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	I I I really think we need to uh 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	The ergonomics , the way it fits in your 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	But 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117		
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	So 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	that's that for now . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	Cheers . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Okay . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	Still , I'll do without that . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	Okay um , now 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	Um oh 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	Um basically 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	that I'd like to discuss with you . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	So , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	and 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	we turn that into a message , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	Now 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	I would have hoped 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	I think that's my only slide actually , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	but unfortunately the technology defeated me , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	So 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	we want an energy source 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	which is there . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	And we've got to think about what that might be . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Hmm-mm . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	Uh typically it would be a battery , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	but I'm open to suggestions . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	Um and 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	then we have the the user interface . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	Oops . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	And the main components in there are the the th the chip 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	that actually has the intelligence of the machine 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	that translates button presses into a message , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	which encodes it 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	and sends the message to the receiver . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	So 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	those are the basic things 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	Thank you . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Hmm . Okay . Right . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	But those things as long as we can get those components , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	of 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	what what does it look like ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	What do the buttons look like ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Uh what does it feel like ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Um is there any um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Well 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	I may be wrong here , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	We're trying to sell four million of 'em , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	you just 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Okay . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	if it goes wrong you chuck it out , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	and that's why I'm a bit concerned . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	Whoop . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Okay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	Isn't that your job ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	Because then 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Oh . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	No , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	the chip composer marketing . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	Oh right . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Oh no , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	the chip composer sender . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Mm . What they cost . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	I I don't believe I know , um . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	Okay . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	but 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	the 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	which is pretty much the same as these existing models , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	just maybe a little bit more inspired , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	Inspired ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	but basically just the same . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	which which is really not very efficient at all . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Well 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	that has another element , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	which are 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	You'd never need uh batteries 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	would y uh 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	but it also has a place , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	so 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	exactly . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	That's a really good idea . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	Well 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	I uh think that's a very interesting idea , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	but um I'm not a very good industrial designer 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and I don't know much about what these things cost . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	I'll do some research for the next meeting . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	Well 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	it's better than my idea about solar , probably . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Uh yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Well 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	but 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	Well 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	Depen 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	it is just so annoying how 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	It would have to sor store up the energy 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Mm . Yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah , I guess . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	and then use it . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	Solar can do that . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	We may be talking quite heavy then . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	M yeah , that would be too heavy 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	and it'd cost too much . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	No , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	Mm-hmm 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	and 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	So 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	you know f 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Definitely , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	exactly . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	And the dock could look very fancy 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	Exactly . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Pretty much , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	so that we'd be looking for the younger end . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	Well 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	I I brought up some 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	exactly , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	but I think you raised some good questions 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	about are there enough of these people out there , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	or are they making purchasing decisions ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	You know , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	these are the 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Mm . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	I was wondering that , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	and who are liable to buy something new , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	I I s usually put more money than brains . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	Yeah , exactly . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	but 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	Oh oh oh 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	I'll make a note of that , Kate . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	Good , good comment . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	It might be good to know 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	I don't know . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	haven't we ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Mm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	Yeah . Yeah , good point . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	That's probably more what it is . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	because we have the relationship with our own department , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Okay . Right . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	are we ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	Probably not . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	Mm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	It has to have big user-friendly buttons 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	that the current styles are just plain awful . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	Do we need um let me 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	Is that agreeable to everyone ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	Br actually , um 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	the enter key 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Do you want the gizmo ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	yeah , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	which might 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	Throw some light on that . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.176	Th 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.177	yeah , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.178	th those are 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	felt like had a lot of charts . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	so we have to get close to finishing . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.180	Okay , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.181	I I 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.182	my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Ah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.183	Um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.184	Exactly . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.185	Again , you know , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	Is that okay with you ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.186	thinking of menus or 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	Sorry , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	I was miles away . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	Would that 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	H how does that work ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	Um well 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	How so so how does that work , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	uh-huh . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.189	and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.190	press power again and use that as an enter um 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	so you press power after you've 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	Then you'd have to have an off te off key . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	um well 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	Okay , yep , mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.192	Mm . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	It's not getting a bit complicated ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Could granny do this , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Well 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	or are we just not aiming at granny ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	Or y 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	yeah . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	Who's got an iPod then ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	I don't 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.193	Mm . Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	um I wish . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	Anyway , uh 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	It's definitely channel , volume , power . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.194	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	Exactly . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Exactly . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	Okay , well . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	Okay . So 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	Thanks for looking at that . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	We don't wanna outsmart 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	I just joined that set last week . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	Hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	Um first grandchild arrived . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Congratulations . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114		
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	Uh . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	Um so are we agreed then of those things ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	And let's go back to agenda 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	D 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	and hook me up . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	Mm . This oughta be fun . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	It probably won't go the first time , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	it'll probably be like a g mess . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	Come on . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	Uh it lost it off here . Uh 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	Oh 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	you're fine . It's fine . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	No , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	it was up there , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	but I couldn't see it down here . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	Mm . This time it should be both . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	There we go . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	Ah okay , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	five minutes to finish , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	it toggles through , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	thank you a lot for telling me . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	yeah . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135		
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	I think you have to cycle through . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	Um right , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	Yeah . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	we're ready to close . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Um will be completed q questionnaire , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	for you , Steph , to do the user interface 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	and for you the trend-watching . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	Um and each of us will get help from our coach . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	Yes . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	Sounds good . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Then that's the end of this meeting . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Okay ? 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	Okay . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Well 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	I think I went over the functions 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	and wrote them down 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	Alright , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	and marked them . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.118	well 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	that's fine then . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	Um and you'd mentioned I 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	I was just gonna say , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	could you reiterate the new project requirements , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	because it they were 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	it has to be for a T_V_ , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	just to keep myself 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	Um the teletext is outdated , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	So 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	we're still in meeting , 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	aren't we ? 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	Yeah , 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	the internet is important , 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	I think I've 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	it's only to be for a T_V_ 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	Okay . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	Sorry , 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	what what actually are these 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	is that the yellow and black ? 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	It doesn't tell me . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	Mm . 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	From their 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	I'll just use it from their website . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2013b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	Okay ? 	
ES2013b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	Okay . 	
ES2013b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	Okay . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	Right . 	
ES2013b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	Thank you .
