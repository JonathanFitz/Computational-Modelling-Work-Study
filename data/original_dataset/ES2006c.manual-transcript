ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Excellent . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	So um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	I sent you the agenda , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	it was on the in the project documents . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	so we'll go round each of you in turn 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	so that's 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Um , do you wanna start again ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Let me 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	we've got forty minutes . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	Right s 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	Um mm , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Let's hope the pen holds out . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	okay , so 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	basically I'll start off by uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Okay , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	so w what you see here is so 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	this is the outside of the remote , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	uh everything else is kind of 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	on pressing this button I a circuit completes , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	you can ge get them printed as you want to , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	Right ? So that's the important point here , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	so these are the different options that we have . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	So . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	And dynamos . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Um 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	Does that mean like a wind-up one ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	A wind-up remote . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	but these are the different things that the company makes , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	so th they'll they'll 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	And charging their remote , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48		
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Yeah , it's a good option . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	So what was what was this k ka 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.5	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	Uh yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.51	But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	For a remote , 'cause you 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.52	But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Yay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Environment friendly . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Okay um so I'll list things 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.56	and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	There are different cases that can be provided . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	and they can be curved with on both the sides . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	These are the three options , right ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.64	would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.65	uh there were different kind of supplements available , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.66	um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Mm-hmm . Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.9	Did you say wool ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Wo wo wood . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	Wood , wood . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	Wood . Oh right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Yeah . Not wool . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	A fluffy remote . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	. 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.12	Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Oh really ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	Huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Um the 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.78	Uh okay , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.79	the interface options now . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.80	So 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.81	we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.82	and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.13		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Ooh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	Sony . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Yeah , yeah , something like that . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.86	So , and they have 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.87	they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.88	The scroll plus push . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.89	So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um in the last decade , so not too recent . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.90	And L_C_D_s , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.91	we can have L_C_D_s . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.92	So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.93	The various electronic options are um uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.96	The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.97	but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.98	or a regular 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.99	or advanced . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.100	And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Um 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.102	okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Um the 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.104	we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Right ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah . Uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.108	besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.109	which is did not explained what i what it was , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.110	but I'm guessing that uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Yeah , on . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.114	Um and uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.115	I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.116	So , these are the different options that we have . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Okay , so 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.118	th that's that's basically 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.119	now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.120	keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Excellent . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	you can sit down , but just 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	we might need you to leap up . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	What are you , PowerPoint , or 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.18	Oh . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16		
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.19	'Kay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	Some sort of radiation ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.123		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	No it's got its little camera in there , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	plug it in . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	'S a 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	Right , interface concept . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	That's fine . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.23	So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.24	Okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.25	So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.26	um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.27	and and which 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.28	uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.73	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Um and then um this uh this um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.34	this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.74	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.35	So some findings um um . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.36	So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.37	and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Um okay , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.39	and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Okay , some of them are here . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.75		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.41	Um well the picture is not very clear , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.42	but as you can see , there are actu 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.43	oi , oh oh oh , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.76		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.44	sorry for that . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.46	'S go back . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.125	That's nice one . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.45	Ah , no , please . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.47	Okay , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.48	so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.50	because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.51	And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	Ugly . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Mm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.52	Um okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	So let's carry on with this . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.54	Um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.55	So uh um o other findings 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.56	um some new things um used , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.57	uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.58	Our own company has developed a new in user interface 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.59	uh wait , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.60	no this is not the one . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.61	Okay , there is a 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.62	we can uh include voice recognition 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.63	and um it allows 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.64	i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.126	Mm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.65	Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.78	It's 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.80	yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.66	Um s another new development is a scroll button , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.67	which was also th also already mentioned . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.68	And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.69	mm sorry uh 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.70	speaker unit I guess it's it should be . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.71	Um and this means that um once 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.72	uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.73	but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.74	for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.75	and it says some hello and your name or whatever . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Uh-huh , hi yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.76	So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.128	Uh sorry , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.129	uh can you go back for a second ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Uh oh yeah are th 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	It's like the like you said , no ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.84	The scroll scroll wheel . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	Yeah , you can't 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.77	No no , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.78	the scroll button is a different thing . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	I I have a picture if you just a moment , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	I'll I'll show you . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	I wasn't completely sure myself , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.82	but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	Look , this one here . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	Oh , it's like the iPod . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	G yeah , no , you can . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.85	it's like you press this or this or 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.133	Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.85	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.134	Alright , right . Okay , okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	and it yeah . It is 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.135	So instead of going down you just spin 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	You just go round 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.136	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	and it is a bit weird at first , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	but it's actually very like fast . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Right . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.139	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	but you've got a lot less control over it . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.141	So maybe I should include that here as well , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.142	L_C_D_s um plus spinning . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.90	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Uh 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.89	Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.92	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.90	It it has to be small , simple . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.91	Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.92	so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.93	and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.95	and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.96	I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.97	There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.93	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.98	So yeah , that's uh that's it . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Excellent . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Okay , straight to trends , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.96	and then we can discuss it all at once . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.97	The project documents . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Excellent . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.99	If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	Cool . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Here it comes . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.101	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	Fabulous . Okay , cool . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.104	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	Um , you know , people want something new , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	something technologically innovative and different , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.148	So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	So 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.106	Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Right . So mm uh so it 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.107	That's over on the interface , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.108	if if you could put 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.150	yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.151	so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.109	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Um and an 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.110	And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.153	yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.111	so that means we need an advanced thing . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.154	Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.157	and the feedback can come through television itself , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.158	so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	Depends how fast your television runs , really , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	don't don't you think ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	and you put the number in the remote 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	and then you wait 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	and then it goes to the T_V_ 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	and then you wait , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	and then it comes , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	so i it actually takes quite a long time . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.113	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.59	And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.160	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.162		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.161	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.114	It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	You know ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.115	so if you're watching something 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.63	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.163	That's true , yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.64	And i it would be like 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.164	that's also 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.65	I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.66	and you could just see that on the remote rather than 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.67	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.68	But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.69	like you have the slidey ones 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.70	and you have the flippy ones 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.71	and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.72	So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.73	or like a minimalist remote control . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.119	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.74	So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.167	Mm right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.75	and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.120	And then you can flip it open . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.76	yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.169	So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah , I think so . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.170	because of style and 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.77	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.78	so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.172	You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yep , yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.123	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.174	So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.79	Okay ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Go on . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.80	Cool . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.81	Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.124		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.82	Sorry , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.176		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.83	I discovered clip art . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.84	Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.85	So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.86	Do you know ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.87	'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.126	and possibly even uneven , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.127	like not not symmet 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.88	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.89	bit of asymmetry and stuff . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.128	yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.90	But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.91	because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.178	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.92	so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.100	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Mm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.94	Um yeah 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.93	, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.95	Um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.131	Something a bit squishy and 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.96	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.97	but I mean y you have to 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.181	we we have 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.101	So it could be like a rubbery 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.182	we have rubber , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.102	yeah , uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.183	but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.98	Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.132	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.133	and it'd help if you drop it , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.134	it protects it as well . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.99	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.135	To some degree . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.184	So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.185	that is the constraint , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.136	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.186	so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.137	Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.100	If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.188	w energy source . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.138	From from bouncing it . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.101	you could just bounce it up and down . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.139	You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.103		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.102	Yeah . Um so yeah , um okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.104		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.191	So probably double curved surface is the way to go , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.192	yeah , . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.103	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.140	Mm yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.194	because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Um 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.104	You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.196	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.105	It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.106	it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Yeah . Yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.198	singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.199	It uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.107	No , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.108	I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.109	I I have one of those s slidey phones 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.110	and I mean the back is essentially straight , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.111	but it's curvy , so . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.201	Uh I think uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.112	Besides , you have four sides to a thing , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Yeah , 'cause the 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.113	so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.114	and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.145	Dunno . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.205	because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.115	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.206	Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.207	It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Nothing to open them . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.116	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.117	Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Right , yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.118	But no , my research didn't tell me anything , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.119	which is why we have all the pictures , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.209		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.120	'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.148		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.210	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Okay , cool . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Anything else ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.150	What've we got ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Uh combine style with a level of functionality , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.123	um beauty and practicality 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.124	and a thing of beauty and p function . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.151	Okay , so . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Cool , thanks . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Okay ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.105	Thanks 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.152	Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.214	Let's let's try to r rub off things and 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.153	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.154	rub off some of those . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.215	yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.106		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.216	so um 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.217	hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.155	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.218	You you got a wind dynamo , yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.107	Yeah uh-hum yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.156	it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Um 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.221	kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.157	I think tha 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.222	but uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.126	It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.223	it's 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.224	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.225	As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.127	I mean if 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.226	this this thing will have to be tapped every time , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.227	which which might be very frustrating for the user . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.158	Depends how much how much movement it really needs . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Kinetic energy it needs 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.229	I don't have too much technical information on that , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.230	yeah , right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.231	Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.160	I'd I'd keep it on . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.232	yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.108	Yeah 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.161	We don't want that 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.234	It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.162	it's no it's not not vegetable . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.109	it's 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.110	yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.111		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.235	Um okay , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.236	we still have all all the options . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.237	Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.163		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.112	N wood is 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.113	I can't n 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.114	how do you 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.115	uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.238	Mm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.116	you can't make it like thin and 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.239	Right . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.117	The wood thing . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.128	I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.118	Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.119	so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.240	Yeah 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.241	if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.120	wi mm-mm yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Mm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.242	it's it's much more uh 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.121	Yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.166	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.122	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.167	and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.243		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.123	U yeah wood is not really yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.244	Right . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.129	Well it's not very cleanable either , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.245	That's true . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.130	do you know . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.124	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.131	It's it's not a practical 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.132	I mean it's it's alright for a table , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.133	but for a remote control , you know . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.246	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.134	And splinters and stuff and 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.247	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.248	okay wood is out . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.135	It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Right . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.125	Yeah , yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.126	in the case of remote control not really . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.250	Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.252	but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.253	nobody seems to be 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.136	You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.127	Yeah , but 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.128	you um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.129	I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.137	G 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.138	yeah , yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Mm right . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.130	Yeah , so for channel numbers but 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.255	Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.256	if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.131	But I th 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.132	yeah 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.133	but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.173	Just for fast 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.134	with a m yeah and w if we dis and 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.135	when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.139		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.258	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.136	but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.140		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.137	but it's it it's more time-consuming . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.141	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.142	I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.259	Mm right . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.138	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.177	And it 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.178	yeah 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.179	L_ L_C_D_ . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.260	So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.262	Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.139	No , no , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.140	I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.141	because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.263	The numbers . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.143	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.144	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.180	Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.265	Or 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.266	on the L_C_D_ we can , you know 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.145	G yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.142	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.143	I would say buttons , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.146	I would think buttons , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.147	yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.144	because it's 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Buttons . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.145	yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.267	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.148	It's it's the 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.146	I 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.149	I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.268	So mm 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Mm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.147	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.150	and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.269	Alright . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.151	but , you know , I mean most of the time 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.148	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.152	I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.271	Right . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.272	Okay , so buttons definitely in 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.273	but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.185	I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.274	Uh okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.186	so if we put down the key um things that we want . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.275	Okay , okay , so the components . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.149	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.276	Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.150	Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah , about the spinning wheel . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.151	So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.153	E either or 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.152	it's uh 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.153	you can al include everything in the spinning if you 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.154	G yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.154	yeah , yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.155	I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.155	in that case . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.156	so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.157	But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.277	Mm um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.190	But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.156	Ah , but I mean you can 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.158		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.159	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.160	but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.191	Th that would be on one side , uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.278	I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.157	Yeah , I um I think so too , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.279	Uh i it 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.192	No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	I mean the case would be 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.159	yeah 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.161	You want an outside of rubber 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.160	the case would be rubber and the the buttons , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.162	and then open it up and 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.280	Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.161	rubber buttons , but then 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.194	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.281	Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.162	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.163	Or maybe like interchangeable cases . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.282	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.164	'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.165	but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.166	but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.167	and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.283	Right , right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.195	Mm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.163		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.284	Right , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.196		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.285	okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.286	Um 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.168	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.169	I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.287	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.288	Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.164	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.198	That's right , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.199	that's what they're after . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.289	So 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.290	I'll rub that out . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.291	And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.292	Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.200	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.165	Yeah 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.166	I think we um 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.167	it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.168	so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.201	I guess . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.171	That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.169	Yeah , does 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Bananas . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.170	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.171	Banana's yellow , yeah , definitely . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.173	but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.174	and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.175	So you could have like 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.203	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.176	I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.205	Green . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.204	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.177	and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.293	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.178		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.294	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.295	Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.296	Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.206	We need the advanced yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.297	um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.207	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.298	but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.299	so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.208	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.300	So I'll rub off the other two . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.209	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.179	So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.210	That was the 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.301	Oh is 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.302	oh the constraint was uh 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.180	If 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.211	We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.303	yeah . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.181	solar panels with the rubber . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.304	Yeah . So 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.212	Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.172	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.173	And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.213	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.305	I think uh 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.214	We've got five more minutes . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.306	we'll have uh uh 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.308	using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.215	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.309	a although it does seem uh interesting . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.216	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.310	But it does not hold any advantages as such for a 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.217	Yeah , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.184	It's just a gimmick . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.218	mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.311	yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.312	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.313	Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.219	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.314	It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.220	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.221	I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.315	Ye yeah , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.316	we we don't have too much information about it , um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.222	but if it's 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.223	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.174	Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.224	It's from the company , so 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.317	Yeah , okay , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.318	so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.226	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.225	Okay . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.319	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.227	And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.320	Flat on the top . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.175	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.321	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.322	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.228	Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Yeah , sure j 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.229	Just so we can 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Sorry , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.188	do you want me to 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.230	Nothing , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.231	it's right , I'm just 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.232	There we go . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.189	What does um I_C_S_ mean ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.323	I_C_s ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.324	Uh integrated circuits . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.190	Okay , cool . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.191	So it's advanced integrated circuits ? 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.325	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.233	Uh oh now I've gone too far . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.326	Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.176	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.234	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.235	We're on our way . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.236	Okay . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.237	So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.238	the advanced chip 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.327	Right . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.239	and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.328	Yep . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.240	and the buttons are also rubber . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.241	We're having push-buttons on the outside 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.242	and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.243	and we're incorporating voice recognition . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.244	That's our overall concept , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.177	Um 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.245	and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.192		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.178		
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.329		
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.246	and be in bright vegetable colours . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.179	Uh-huh . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.180	So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.247	I think it's on the 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.193	Imagine it would be inside . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.181	Okay . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.194	So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.330	Mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.195	so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.182	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.196	and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.183	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.184	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.248	Mm-mm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.197	Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.249	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.250	On the 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.198	You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.251	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.199	and four of the buttons are in the wheel , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.200	and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.252	In the centre , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.253	yeah , sure . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.201	yeah . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.185	Mm yeah . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.254	Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.255	In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.331	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.256	which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.257	Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.258	and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.259	And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.260	and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.332		
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.186	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.333	Cool . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.261	Is that all okay ? 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.262	And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.187	Yeah . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.334	Yeah , okay . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.188	Mm-hmm . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.202	Cool , 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.203	I'm gonna go and sit on my own . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.263	Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . 	
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.204	I know , I'm hated . 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.264	Unplug yourself . 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.189	Hmm . 	
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.335		
ES2006c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.205	I've got a bit tangled up in all this 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.190	So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.265	I dunno , 	
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.266	maybe I would car 	
ES2006c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.191	we need to
