This file contains the results of using nested cross-validation (cv) on the dataset. This consists of an outer and inner cv.

	Number of outer cv folds: 3
	Number of inner cv folds: 3

Dataset: data/original_dataset/
Response question: vraag16


ARCHITECTURE AND HYPERPARAMETERS

Architecture: Fully-connected (dense) net
Batch size: 20
Max number of sentences examined in transcript: 1500

Feature derivation methods: ['turn taking', 'mrc', 'sentiment', 'pronouns', 'filled_pauses', 'all']

[MANUAL EDIT: These are all the features used. They were first all used individually (first turn taking features, then mrc features, etc.). The 'all' indicates that all features were then examined together]


Possible hyperparameter values: {'num_layer': [2, 3, 4, 5], 'neurons_per_layer': [50, 500, 1500], 'perc_dropout': [0, 0.2], 'optimizer': ['rmsprop', 'Adam'], 'learning_rate': [0.0001, 0.01], 'act_func': ['relu'], 'epochs': [25, 100, 200]}

[MANUAL EDIT: Every combination of these hyperparameters values were examined in the inner cv]


RESULTS

[MANUAL EDIT: For each of these three outer fold combinations, all the different hyperparameters and feature combinations listed above were tested in the inner cv. Whichever combination had the lowest average score ('Average inner cv score') was chosen. Using this chosen combination, a model was then trained on the other two outer folds, and tested on the remaining outer fold ('Outer fold score'). All scores are MSE.]

Fold combination #1:
	Model type: Neural Net
	Chosen hyperparameters: {'act_func': 'relu', 'epochs': 200, 'learning_rate': 0.0001, 'neurons_per_layer': 500, 'num_layer': 5, 'optimizer': 'rmsprop', 'perc_dropout': 0.2}
	Chosen features: mrc
	Average inner cv score: 7.4966
	Outer fold score: 14.7812

Fold combination #2:
	Model type: Neural Net
	Chosen hyperparameters: {'act_func': 'relu', 'epochs': 200, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'neurons_per_layer': 1500, 'num_layer': 5, 'optimizer': 'rmsprop', 'perc_dropout': 0.2}
	Chosen features: turn taking
	Average inner cv score: 6.9440
	Outer fold score: 11.0354

Fold combination #3:
	Model type: Neural Net
	Chosen hyperparameters: {'act_func': 'relu', 'epochs': 100, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'neurons_per_layer': 500, 'num_layer': 2, 'optimizer': 'rmsprop', 'perc_dropout': 0}
	Chosen features: all
	Average inner cv score: 8.6343
	Outer fold score: 7.8496


NOTES

If the chosen model is a baseline model, then hyperparameters will be NaN since these are only relevant to neural nets.
If the chosen model is the alternative baseline model, then features will also be NaN since the alt baseline only uses the response variable.
